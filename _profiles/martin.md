My background is in philosophical logic, with a focus on formal systems for trial-and-error processes. Recently, my research interests have shifted somewhat towards argumentation theory and (logical) philosophy of language. In particular the application of foundational theories in philosophical semantics and pragmatics to practically useful argumentation analysis.
