introduce some of our research on Iris, a higher-order concurrent separation logic framework, implemented and verified in the Coq proof assistant, which can be used for mathematical reasoning about safety and correctness of concurrent higher-order imperative programs. Iris has been used for many different applications; see iris-project.org for a list of research papers. However, in this talk I will focus on the Iris base logic (and its semantics) and sketch how one may define useful program logics on top of the base logic. The base logic is a higher-order intuitionistic modal logic, which, in particular, supports the definition of recursive predicates and whose type of propositions is itself recursively defined.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-12-20 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 20 December 2021, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/21b%20ht/2021/12/10/dominik-wehr/"> <h3>Abstract Cyclic Proofs</h3> <h4>Dominik Wehr, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>Cyclic proof systems permit derivations to contain cycles, thereby serving as finite representations of non-wellfounded derivation trees. Such cyclic proof systems have been proposed for a broad range of logics, especially those with fixed-point features or inductively defined objects of reasoning. The soundness of such systems is commonly ensured by only considering those cyclic derivations as proofs which satisfy a so-called global trace condition.</p> </div></summary> <p>&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>In this talk, I will present a category theoretical notion, the trace category, which generalizes the trace condition of many cyclic proof systems. Indeed, a handful of different trace categories are sufficient to capture the trace conditions of all cyclic proof systems from the literature I have examined so far. The arising abstract notion of cyclic proof allows for the derivation of generalized renditions of standard results of cyclic proof theory, such as the decidability of proof-checking and the regularizability of certain non-wellfounded proofs. It also opens the door to broader inquiries into the structural properties of trace condition based cyclic and non-wellfounded proof systems, some of which I will touch on in this talk, time permitting.

Gärdenfors (2019, 2020) argues that humans make sense of domains by appealing to various types of invariances in sensory signals. In this talk, I present work by Quinon and Gärdenfors (manuscript) in which the aim is to extend the analysis in terms of invariances to the domain of numbers. We focus on several perspectives relating invariances: cognitive modeling, formal mathematical and experimental.</p> </div></summary> <p>&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>As theoretical background, we assume that numbers are properties of collections (Simons 1982, 2007, 2011; Johansson 2015; Angere 2014). We observe that the domain of number is determined by two types of invariances. First, the concept of collection itself depends on being invariant under the location of its objects. Second, the determinant invariance of the domain of number is the fungibility of objects: If an object in a collection is exchanged for another object, the collection will still contain the same number of objects. Fungibility will be shown to be closely related to one-to-one correspondences.</p> <p>We first introduce the concept of a collection and show how it differs from the concept of a set. Then we present the invariance of location of objects that applies to collections and we introduce fungibility as a second type of invariance. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by empirical material from experiments of developmental psychologists.</p> <p>This is joint work with Peter Gärdenfors (Lund).</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-11-26 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 26 November 2021, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 21b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2021/11/22/sara-l-uckelman/"> <h3>John Eliot’s Logick Primer: A bilingual English-Wôpanâak logic textbook</h3> <h4>Sara L.

This includes branching quantifiers, notions of dependence and independence, trace quantification in linear-time temporal logic (LTL), and probabilistic notions from quantum mechanics.</p> <p>Team semantics is based on the same notion of structure as Tarskian semantics, but instead of a single assignment satisfying a formula (or not), in team semantics a set, or a <em>team</em>, of assignments satisfies a formula (or not). In other words, the semantic value of a formula is lifted from a set of assignments (those that satisfy the formula) to a set of teams of assignments.</p> </div></summary> <p>In almost all (with only one exception that I’m aware of) logical systems based on team semantics this lifting operation is the power set operation, and as a result the set of teams satisfying a formula is closed downwards. This is often taken as a basic and foundational principle of team semantics.</p> <p>In this talk I will discuss this principle and present some ideas on why, or why not, the power set operation is the most natural lift operation.

In the classical Boolean semantics, a model of a formula assigns to each (instantiated) literal a Boolean value. K-interpretations, for a semiring K, generalize this by assigning to each such literal a value from K. We then interpret 0 as false and all other semiring values as nuances of true, which provide additional information, depending on the semiring: For example, the Boolean semiring over {0,1} corresponds classical semantics, the Viterbi-semiring can model confidence scores, the tropical semiring is used for cost analysis, and min-max-semirings (A, max, min, a, b) for a totally ordered set (A,&lt;) can model different access levels. Most importantly, semirings of polynomials, such as N[X], allow us to track certain literals by mapping them to different indeterminates. The overall value of the formula is then a polynomial that describes precisely what combinations of literals prove the truth of the formula.</p> </div></summary> <p>This can also be used for strategy analysis in games. Evaluating formulae that define winning regions in a given game in an appropriate semiring of polynomials provides not only the Boolean information on who wins, but also tells us how they win and which strategies they might use. For this approach, the case of Büchi games is of special interest, not only due to their practical importance, but also because it is the simplest case where the logical definition of the winning region involves a genuine alternation of a greatest and a least fixed point. We show that, in a precise sense, semiring semantics provide information about all absorption-dominant strategies – strategies that win with minimal effort, and we discuss how these relate to positional and the more general persistent strategies. This information enables further applications such as game synthesis or determining minimal modifications to the game needed to change its outcome.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-10-25 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 25 October 2021, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/21b%20ht/2021/10/15/joao-pedro-paulos/"> <h3>A collection of small closed sets: sets of uniqueness</h3> <h4>João Pedro Paulos, Chalmers</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Sets of uniqueness and their properties are traditionally investigated in Harmonic Analysis.

More specifically, let EA (Elementary Arithmetic) be the fragment I∆0 + Exp of PA, and CT<sup>−</sup>[EA] be the extension of EA by the commonly studied axioms of compositional truth CT<sup>−</sup>. The truth theory delivers a natural preorder on the set of axiomatizations: an axiomatization A is greater or equal to an axiomatization B if and only if, over CT<sup>-</sup>[EA], the assertion “All axioms from A are true” implies “All axioms from B are true”. Our focus is dominantly on two types of axiomatizations, namely: (1) schematic axiomatizations that are deductively equivalent to PA, and (2) axiomatizations that are proof-theoretically equivalent to the canonical axiomatization of PA.</p> </div></summary> <p>The first part of the talk focuses on the axiomatizations of type (1). We adapt the argument by Visser and Pakhomov (“On a question of Krajewski’s”, JSL 84(1), 2019) to show that there is no weakest axiomatization of this form (even if the axiomatizations are ordered by relative interpretability). Secondly, we sketch an argument showing that such axiomatizations with the given ordering form a countably universal partial order. This part is based on our joint work with Ali Enayat, available at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353496287_Axiomatizations_of_Peano_Arithmetic_A_truth-theoretic_view" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353496287_Axiomatizations_of_Peano_Arithmetic_A_truth-theoretic_view</a></p> <p>In the second part of the talk we discuss axiomatizations of type (2). We narrow our attention to such axiomatizations A for which CT<sup>-</sup>[EA] + “All axioms from A are true” is a conservative extension of PA. We explain why such theories have very diverse metamathematical properties (e.g. large speed-up). To illustrate our methods we show that, with the given ordering, such axiomatizations do not form a lattice. This is a work still in progress.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-10-01 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 1 October 2021, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 21b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2021/09/27/anupam-das/"> <h3>On the proof theoretic strength of cyclic reasoning</h3> <h4>Anupam Das, University of Birmingham</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>Cyclic (or circular) proofs are now a common technique for demonstrating metalogical properties of systems incorporating (co)induction, including modal logics, predicate logics, type systems and algebras.

More than often, it turned out that the axioms then would be provable from the theorems, and the subject was named Reverse Mathematics. In this talk we will survey some of the philosophy behind, and results of, the early reverse mathematics, based on the formalisation of mathematics within second order number theory.</p> </div></summary> <p>In 2005, Ulrich Kohlenbach introduced higher order reverse mathematics, and we give a brief explanation of the what and why? of Kohlenbach’s approach. In an ongoing project with Sam Sanders we have studied the strength of classical theorems of late 19th/early 20th century mathematics, partly within Kohlenbach’s formal typed theory and partly by their, in a generalised sense, constructive content. In the final part of the talk I will give some examples of results from this project, mainly from the perspective of higher order computability theory.

He made a resolution to teach himself Aristotelian logic, armed with an Arabic translation of Aristotle and a century-old Arabic textbook of logic. A couple of years later, around his eighteenth birthday, he wrote a brief report of what he had learned.</p> </div></summary> <p>Six months ago I started to examine this report - I suspect I am the first logician to do that. It contains many surprising things. Besides introducing some new ideas that readers of Avicenna know from his later works, it also identifies some specific points of modal logic where Avicenna was sure that Aristotle had made a mistake. People had criticised Aristotle’s logic before, but not at these points. At first Avicenna had no clear understanding of how to do modal logic, and it took him another thirty years to justify all the criticisms of Aristotle in his report. But meanwhile he discovered for himself how to defend a new logic by building new foundations. I think the logic itself is interesting, but the talk will concentrate on another aspect. These recent discoveries mean that Avicenna is the earliest known logician who creates new logics and tells us what he is doing, and why, at each stage along the way.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-05-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 May 2021, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/21a%20vt/2021/05/21/mattias-granberg-olsson/"> <h3>A proof of conservativity of fixed points over Heyting arithmetic via truth</h3> <h4>Mattias Granberg Olsson, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>I will present work in progress (together with Graham Leigh) on a novel proof of the conservativity of the intuitionistic fix-point theory over Heyting arithmetic (HA), originally proved in full generality by Arai [1].</p> </div></summary> <p>We make use of the work of van den Berg and van Slooten [2] on realizability in Heyting arithmetic over Beeson’s logic of partial terms (HAP). Let IF be the extension of Heyting arithmetic by fix-points, denoted \hat{ID}<sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub> in the literature. The proof is divided into four parts: First we extend the inclusion of HA into HAP to IF into a similar theory IFP in the logic of partial terms. We then show that every theorem of this theory provably has a realizer in the theory IFP(Λ) of fix-points for almost negative operator forms only. Constructing a hierarchy stratifying the class of almost negative formulae and partial truth predicates for this hierarchy, we use Gödel’s diagonal lemma to show IFP(Λ) is interpretable in HAP. Finally we use use the result of [2] that adding the schema of “self-realizability” for arithmetic formulae to HAP is conservative over HA.

Gheorghiu, we applied a similar method to the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), a substructural logic that freely combines intuitionistic logic and multiplicative linear logic.

The original Tr-cut-elimination argument for the theory of Tarskian, compositional truth CT[B] by Halbach is not conclusive. This strategy has been corrected by Graham Leigh: Leigh supplemented Halbach’s strategy with the machinery of approximations (introduced by Kotlarski, Krajewski and Lachlan in the context of their M-Logic). In the talk we investigate a different, and arguably simpler way of supplementing Halbach’s original strategy. It is based on an adaptation of the Takeuti/Buss free-cut elimination strategy for first-order logic to the richer truth-theoretic context. If successful, the strategy promises to generalize to the type-free setting in a straightforward way.
