<h4>Alexandru Baltag, University of Amsterdam</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>I present a topological epistemic logic, motivated by a famous epistemic puzzle: the Surprise Exam Paradox. It is a fixed-point modal logic, with modalities for knowledge (modelled as the universal modality), knowability of a proposition (represented by the topological interior operator), and (un)knowability of the actual world. The last notion has a non-self-referential reading (modelled by Cantor derivative: the set of limit points of a given set) and a self-referential one (modelled by the so-called perfect core of a given set: its largest subset which is a fixed point of relativized derivative). I completely axiomatize this logic, showing that it is decidable and PSPACE-complete, as well as briefly explain how the same model-theoretic method can be elaborated to prove the completeness and decidability of the full topological mu-calculus. Finally, I apply it to the analysis of the Surprise Exam Paradox and other puzzles.</p> </div></summary> <p>References:</p> <ul> <li>A. Baltag, N. Bezhanishvili, D. Fernández-Duque.

I then focus on intuitionistic propositional logic and show that it is ‘Carnap categorical’: the only interpretation of the connectives consistent with the usual intuitionistic consequence relation is the standard one. This holds relative to most well-known semantics with respect to which intuitionistic logic is sound and complete; among them Kripke semantics, Beth semantics, Dragalin semantics, and topological semantics. It also holds for algebraic semantics, although categoricity in that case is different in kind from categoricity relative to possible worlds style semantics.

In the first chapter of (Weyl 1918), Weyl introduces a predicative concept of set, according to which sets are built ‘from the bottom up’ starting from the natural numbers. Weyl clearly contrasts this predicative concept of set with the concept of arbitrary set, which he finds wanting, especially when working with infinite sets. In the second chapter of Das Kontinuum, he goes on to show that large portions of 19th century analysis can be developed on the basis of his predicative concept of set.</p> </div></summary> <p>Das Kontinuum inspired fundamental ideas in mathematical logic and beyond, such as the logical analysis of predicativity of the 1950-60’s, Solomon Feferman’s work on predicativity and Errett Bishop’s constructive mathematics.

The question arises whether ill-founded and cyclic systems can be also be designed for intuitionistic versions of these logics. In this talk, I will present ongoing research aimed at developing an ill-founded sequent calculus for intuitionistic linear temporal logic.

One such rule is the cut rule, which is a sequent calculus analogue of the well-known modus ponens rule. As the cut rule introduces new formulas into a proof, it makes proofs non-analytic. Therefore, much effort is devoted to show that the cut rule can be eliminated from a given calculus without changing the set of derivable sequents. Such a cut-elimination theorem is established by showing how instances of the cut rule in a given proof can be pushed upwards until the premises of the instances are axioms. One then shows that in this case the instances of cut can be eliminated from the proof. However, this standard strategy does not work when one considers so-called non-wellfounded proofs, which are proofs in which some branches are allowed to be infinitely long. Clearly, in such a setting it is not enough to simply push instances of cut upwards, as a leaf might never be reached. In this talk I will present ongoing research on cut-elimination for non-wellfounded proofs for a fragment of the modal mu-calculus. I will discuss the basic idea how to construct a cut-free proof from a given non-wellfounded proof and present some of the current problems of my method.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-11-11 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 11 November 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 22b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/22b%20ht/2022/10/28/thomas-studer/"> <h3>Cut-elimination for modal logics with fixed points</h3> <h4>Thomas Studer, University of Bern</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Modal fixed point logics are extensions of modal logics with operators denoting least, respectively greatest, fixed points of certain positive formulas. Logics of this kind include temporal logics, logics of common knowledge, program logics, and most famously, the modal mu-calculus. We present a survey of deductive systems for the logic of common knowledge as a typical example of a model fixed point logic. In particular, we present two different Hilbert-style axiomatizations and several infinitary cut-free sequent systems that are based on omega-rules.

And thus, of what it means to be a logic. The basic idea behind ST is that it evaluates the premises and the conclusions of its consequence relation differently, with the premises held to stricter standards while conclusions are treated more tolerantly. More specifically, ST is a three-valued logic with left sides of sequents understood as if in Kleene’s Strong Three Valued Logic, and right sides as if in Priest’s Logic of Paradox. Surprisingly, this hybrid validates the same sequents that classical logic does, though it differs from classical logic at the metaconsequence level. A version of this result has been extended to meta, metameta , etc. consequence levels, creating a very interesting hierarchy of logics. All this is work of others, and I will summarize it.</p> </div></summary> <p>My contribution to the subject is to show that the original ideas behind ST are, in fact, much more general than it first seemed, and an infinite family of many valued logics have Strict/Tolerant counterparts. Besides classical logic, this family includes both Kleene’s and Priest’s logics themselves, as well as first degree entailment. For instance, for both the Kleene and the Priest logic, the corresponding strict/tolerant logic is six-valued, but with differing sets of strictly and tolerantly designated truth values. There is a reverse notion, of Tolerant/Strict logics, which exist for the same structures. And the hierarchy going through meta, metameta, \ldots consequence levels exists for the same infinite family of many valued logics. In a similar way all this work extends to modal and quantified many valued logics. In brief, we have here a very general phenomenon.</p> <p>I will present a sketch of the basic generalizations, of Strict/Tolerant and Tolerant/Strict, but I will not have time to discuss the hierarchies of such logics, nor will I have time to give proofs, beyond a basic sketch of the ideas involved.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-10-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 October 2022, 16:00</time>, Online   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/22b%20ht/2022/10/14/guilermo-menendez-turata/"> <h3>A Cyclic Proof System for Full Computation Tree Logic</h3> <h4>Guillermo Menéndez Turata, University of Amsterdam</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Full Computation Tree Logic, commonly denoted CTL*, extends Linear Temporal Logic LTL by path quantification for reasoning about branching time. In contrast to traditional Computation Tree Logic CTL, path quantifiers may be freely combined with temporal operators, resulting in a more expressive language. We present a sound and complete hypersequent calculus for CTL*. The proof system is cyclic in the sense that proofs are finite trees with back-edges. A simple annotation mechanism on formulas provides a syntactic success condition on non-axiomatic leaves to guarantee soundness. Completeness is established by relating cyclic proofs to a natural ill-founded sequent calculus for the logic. This is joint work with B. Afshari and Graham E.

They typically reveal how he arrived at his results, as with the incompleteness theorem. An extreme case are Gödel’s 1938 results on set theory, preceded by some 700 pages of notes never studied before. Secondly, his threshold for publishing was by 1940 so high that some two thousand pages of developments and results remained unknown. One highlight here is a series of notebooks titled “Resultate Grundlagen” in which numerous anticipations of later results in set theory are found. A second main topic are the relations between modal and intuitionistic logic. In particular, Gödel gives a syntactic translation from S4 to intuitionistic logic by methods that are readily generalizable to any decent intermediate logics. These newly discovered methods are, even by today’s standards, a clear step ahead in the study of interrelations between systems of non-classical logics.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-09-26 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 26 September 2022, 16:00</time>, Online   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2022/09/16/clasp-conference/"> <h3>CLASP Conference on (Dis)embodiment</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>(Dis)embodiment is a conference organized by the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/clasp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP)</a>, at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science.

The underlying (minimal) logic has just implication and universal quantification as primitive connectives; existence, disjunction and conjunction are inductively defined. The axioms of TCF are the defining axioms for (co)inductive predicates, bisimilarity axioms and invariance axioms stating that ‘‘to assert is to realize’’ (Feferman 1978) for realizability-free formulas. Using these one can prove in TCF a soundness theorem: the term extracted from a realizability-free proof of a formula A is a realizer of A. TCF is implemented in the Minlog proof assistant.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-09-02 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 2 September 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 22b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/2022/2022/06/22/sara-negri-research/"> <h3>On modal embeddings</h3> <h4>Sara Negri, University of Genoa</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Motivated by the difficulty in proving faithfulness of various modal embeddings (starting with Gödel’s translation of intuitionistic logic into S4), we use labelled calculi to obtain simple and uniform faithfulness proofs for the embedding of intermediate logics into their modal companions, and of intuitionistic logic into provability logic, including extensions to infinitary logics.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-06-22 10:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Wednesday, 22 June 2022, 10:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2022 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/2022/2022/06/20/sara-negri-public/"> <h3>Syntax and semantics in synergy</h3> <h4>Sara Negri, University of Genoa</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Syntax and semantics, often considered as conflicting aspects of logic, have turned out to be intertwined in a methodology for generating complete proof systems for wide families of non-classical logics.

Thus enriched, the calculi not only constitute a tool for the automatisation of reasoning, but can also be used at the meta-level to establish general structural properties of logical systems and direct proofs of completeness up to decidability in the terminating case. The calculi, on the other hand, can be used to find simplified models through conservativity results.

In the area of description logic, deciding whether a logical theory is a conservative extension of another theory is a fundamental reasoning problem with applications in ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology modularity, ontology reuse and ontology versioning. It has been observed in recent years that conservative extensions are decidable in many modal and description logics, given that they can often be characterized elegantly in terms of appropriate notions of bisimulations. But no work has been done for more expressive logics such as the two-variable fragment and the guarded fragment, which are considered to be generalizations of modal and description logics, and are typically used to explain their good computational behavior.</p> </div></summary> <p>&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>In this talk, I attempt to fill this gap by considering the decidability of conservative extensions in the two-variable guarded fragment (<sc>gfo2</sc>). I will show that conservative extensions are decidable in <sc>gfo</sc>2 and that the computational complexity is 2<sc>exptime</sc>-complete. To prove these results I will rely on an automata-based approach, which consists in first giving a model-theoretic characterization of conservative extensions in terms of guarded bisimulations, to then use it as a foundation for a decision procedure based on tree automata. Since the usual notion of guarded bisimulations fail to characterize conservative extensions in <sc>gfo2</sc>, I will report on alternative model-theoretic characterizations in terms of bounded guarded bisimulations and the challenge of combining them with automata techniques.</p> <p>This talk is based on joint work with Carsten Lutz, Jean Christoph Jung, Thomas Schneider, and Frank Wolter: <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7464/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2017-108.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7464/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2017-108.pdf</a></p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-06-03 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 3 June 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 22a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2022/05/30/%C3%B8ystein-linnebo/"> <h3>Potentialism in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics</h3> <h4>Øystein Linnebo, University of Oslo</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Aristotle famously claimed that the only coherent form of infinity is potential, not actual.

Similarly, Cantini (1996) and Kahle (2003) introduced universes for axiomatic truth theories over TON (total applicative theory). Set-theoretic universes are usually large sets that are closed under several operations like complements, whereas truth-theoretic universes can be seen as quasi-truth predicates which satisfy some axioms for the truth predicate. Cantini and Kahle then showed that by adding the axiom assuring the existence of universes, several truth theories become proof-theoretically stronger.</p> </div></summary> <p>In this talk, I will formulate the theory VFU, an extension of Cantini’s supervaluational truth theory VF (cf. Kahle, 2002) with the universe-generating axiom, and then prove that VFU has the same proof-theoretic strength as KPi (Kripke-Platek set theory with the recursively inaccessible universe) and T0 (Feferman’s explicit mathematics with the inductive generation axiom). To determine the lower bound, I show that T0 is relatively interpretable in VFU. As for the upper bound, I give a truth-as-provability interpretation for VFU, where the truth predicate is understood as the provability in a certain infinite derivation system. As this is formalisable in KPi, a relative interpretation of VFU in KPi is obtained. Therefore, all the three systems are proof-theoretically equivalent. Finally, I would like to mention the possibility of constructing natural numbers in VFU.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-05-20 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 20 May 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 22a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/22a%20vt/2022/05/06/rasmus-blanck/"> <h3>Never trust an unsound theory</h3> <h4>Rasmus Blanck, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>What is a Gödel sentence?

As a complement to our fragment approach, we also discuss another way of controlling complexity: changing the semantics of counting to reason about ‘mass’ or other aggregating notions than cardinalities. Finally, we return to the basic reasoning practices that lie embedded in natural language, confronting our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary, monotonicity reasoning, and procedural semantics via semantic automata.
