The problem of optimising automated explanations for entailments in knowledge bases is tackled by modelling deductive reasoning processes using the cognitive architecture ACT-R.
This results in the model SHARP which simulates the algorithm for deciding inconsistency of an ABox in the description logic ALE as executed by a human.
More precisely, SHARP enables predicting the inference time of this task, which is assumed to reflect cognitive load of a human agent.
With the inference time, two complexity measures on ABoxes are defined that should correlate with cognitive load by design.
