meaning explanation or just another realizability interpretation?</h3> <h4>Göran Sundholm, Leiden University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>Around 1930 a major paradigm shift occurred in the foundations of mathematics; we may call it the METAMATHEMATICAL TURN. Until then the task of a logician had been to design and explain a full-scale formal language that was adequate for the practice of mathematical analysis in such a way that the axioms and rules of inference of the theory were rendered evident by the explanations.</p> </div></summary> <p>The metamathematical turn changed the status of the formal languages: now they became (meta)mathematical objects of study. We no longer communicate <em>with</em> the aid of the formal systems – we communicate <em>about</em> them. Kleene’s realizability (JSL 1945) gave a metamathematical (re-)interpretation of arithmetic <em>inside</em> arithmetic. Heyting and Kolmogorov (1931-2), on the other hand, had used “proofs” of <em>propositions</em>, respectively “solutions” to <em>problems,</em> in order to explain the meaning of the mathematical language, rather than reinterpret it internally.</p> <p>We now have the choice to view the Curry-Howard isomorphism, say, as a variant of realizability, when it will be an <em>internal</em> mathematical re-interpretation, or to adopt an <em>atavistic,</em> Frege-like, viewpoint and look at the language as being rendered meaningful. This perspective will be used to discuss another paradigm shift, namely that of distinguishing <em>constructivism</em> and <em>intuitionism</em>. The hesitant attitude of Gödel, Kreisel, and Michael Dummett, will be spelled out, and, at the hand of unpublished source material, a likely reason given.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-12-18 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 18 December 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23b%20ht/2023/12/08/tjeerd-fokkens/"> <h3>Cutting through SHARP</h3> <h4>Tjeerd Fokkens, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The model SHARP is a result of (somewhat naively) implementing a tableaux-based reasoning algorithm of the description logic ALE into the cognitive architecture ACT-R.

The resulting framework allows one to reason about the state of affairs in which one agent (or group of agents) has ‘epistemic superiority’ over another agent (or group). I will present different examples of epistemic superiority and I will draw a connection to the logic of functional dependence by A. Baltag and J. van Benthem. At the level of group attitudes, I will further introduce the new concept of ‘common distributed knowledge’, which combines features of both common knowledge and distributed knowledge.

Carnap’s focus was classical propositional logic (CPL), but his question can be asked for any logical language. The rest of the talk gives a very general positive answer to this question for IPL: the usual IPL consequence relation does indeed determine the standard intuitionistic meaning of the propositional connectives, according to most well-known semantics for IPL, such as Kripke semantics, Beth semantics, Dragalin semantics, topological semantics, and algebraic semantics.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-10-30 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 30 October 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23b%20ht/2023/10/27/giacomo-barlucchi/"> <h3>The Limit of Recursion in State-based Systems</h3> <h4>Giacomo Barlucchi, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>We prove that ω<sup>2</sup> strictly bounds the iterations required for modal definable functions to reach a fixed point across all countable structures. In doing so, we both extend and correct the previously claimed result on closure ordinals of the alternation-free μ-calculus. The new approach sees a reincarnation of Kozen’s well-annotations, originally devised for showing the finite model property for the modal μ-calculus. We develop a theory of conservative well-annotations where minimality of the annotation is guaranteed, and isolate relevant parts of the structure that necessitate an unfolding of fixed points. This adoption of well-annotations enables a direct and clear pumping process that rules out closure ordinals between ω<sup>2</sup> and the limit of countability.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-10-27 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 27 October 2023, 10:15</time>, J303   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23b%20ht/2023/10/13/ivan-di-liberti/"> <h3>Pictures at an exhibition: (1)70 years of functorial semantics</h3> <h4>Ivan Di Liberti, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Boole, Tarski, Stone, Lawvere, Reyes, Makkai</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-10-13 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 13 October 2023, 10:15</time>, J303   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23b%20ht/2023/09/29/graham-leigh/"> <h3>An axiomatic theory of falsity</h3> <h4>Graham E Leigh, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Compositional theories of truth tend to follow the Tarskian tradition, either the model-theoretic semantics for classical predicate logic or its natural generalisations to many-value and possible-worlds. Other realisations of truth, which includes computational interpretations and game semantics, have been largely ignored by truth theorists. In this talk I will present axiomatic rendering of Krivine’s “classical realisability”, a ‘truth as programs’ semantics for classical logic that validates extensions of Peano arithmetic. What sets this conception of truth apart from the Tarskian view is its treatment of falsity as primitive and truth as a derived notion.

Hence, the logic can be used as a formalism to give agents, e.g. robots, a Theory of Mind, allowing them to take the perspective of other agents. In my research, I have combined DEL with techniques from automated planning in order to describe a theory of what I call Epistemic Planning: planning where agents explicitly reason about the mental states of others. The talk will introduce epistemic planning based on DEL, address issues of computational complexity, and demonstrate applications in cognitive robotics and human-robot collaboration.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-09-25 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 25 September 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23b%20ht/2023/09/15/gianluca-curzi/"> <h3>Infinitary cut-elimination via finite approximations</h3> <h4>Gianluca Curzi, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>We investigate non-wellfounded proof systems based on parsimonious logic, a weaker variant of linear logic where the exponential modality ! is interpreted as a constructor for streams over finite data.

There are, however, interesting non-normal logics that are not, but which nevertheless satisfy a weak form of conjunctive closure. One example is a notion of group knowledge in epistemic logic: somebody-knows. While something is general knowledge if it is known by <em>everyone</em>, this notion holds if it is known by <em>someone</em>. Somebody-knows is thus weaker than general knowledge but stronger than distributed knowledge. We introduce a modality for somebody-knows in the style of standard group knowledge modalities, and study its properties. Unlike most other group knowledge modalities, somebody-knows is not a normal modality; in particular it lacks the conjunctive closure property. We provide an equivalent neighbourhood semantics for the language with a single somebody-knows modality, together with a completeness result: the somebody-knows modalities are completely characterised by the modal logic EMN extended with a particular weak conjunctive closure axiom. The neighbourhood semantics and the completeness and complexity results also carry over other logics with weak conjunctive closure, including the logic of so-called local reasoning (Fagin et al., 1995) with bounded “frames of mind”, correcting an existing completeness result in the literature (Allen 2005). The talk is based on joint work with Yi N. Wang.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-08-28 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 28 August 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/05/26/raheleh-jalali/"> <h3>General form of rules implies feasible admissibility</h3> <h4>Raheleh Jalali, Czech Academy of Sciences</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>In this talk, we introduce a general family of sequent-style calculi over the modal language and its fragments to capture the essence of all constructively acceptable systems. Calling these calculi constructive, we show that any strong enough constructive sequent calculus, satisfying a mild technical condition, feasibly admits all Visser’s rules, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm that reads a proof of the premise of a Visser’s rule and provides a proof for its conclusion. As a positive application, we show the feasible admissibility of Visser’s rules in several sequent calculi for intuitionistic modal logics, including CK, IK and their extensions by the modal axioms T, B, 4, 5, the modal axioms of bounded width and depth and the propositional lax logic. On the negative side, we show that if a strong enough intuitionistic modal logic (satisfying a mild technical condition) does not admit at least one of Visser’s rules, then it cannot have a constructive sequent calculus. Consequently, no intermediate logic other than IPC has a constructive sequent calculus.

For modal logics, limit behavior for models and frames may differ. In 1994, Halpern and Kapron proved zero-one laws for classes of models corresponding to the modal logics K, T, S4, and S5. They also proposed zero-one laws for the corresponding classes of frames, but their zero-one law for K-frames has since been disproved, and so has more recently their zero-one law for S4-frames.</p> </div></summary> <p>Provability logic was one of the main interests of Per Lindström. In this talk, we prove zero-one laws for provability logic with respect to both model and frame validity. Moreover, we axiomatize validity in almost all irreflexive transitive finite models and in almost all irreflexive transitive finite frames, leading to two different axiom systems. In the proofs, we use a combinatorial result by Kleitman and Rothschild about the structure of finite (strict) partial orders: almost all of them consist of only three layers. Finally, we present empirical results in order to give an idea of the number of elements from which onwards a formula’s almost sure validity or almost sure invalidity stabilizes in such three-layer Kleitman-Rothschild frames. We also discuss possible extensions of the zero-one laws to the modal logics S4 and K4.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-05-11 18:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Thursday, 11 May 2023, 18:00</time>, J439, Humanisten   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2023 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/04/28/wehr-licentiate/"> <h3>Representation matters in cyclic proof theory</h3> <h4>Licentiate defence: Dominik Wehr, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Public defence of Dominik Wehr’s Licentiate thesis.</p> <p><strong>Opponent</strong> Associate Professor Anupam Das, University of Birmingham<br> <strong>Examiner</strong> Docent Fredrik Engström, Göteborgs universitet<br> Thesis available at the <a href="https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/75984" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gothenburg University Library Archive</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-28 14:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 28 April 2023, 14:00</time>, J439   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/wofpip"> <h3>Workshop on Fixed Points and Ill-founded Proofs, 27-28 April, 2023</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Held on 27-28 April, 2023 at the University of Gothenburg, this workshop brought together researchers working on various aspects of fixed point logics and ill-founded proofs.

Implosion</h3> <h4>Neil Tennant, Ohio State University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>We set out five basic requirements for a logical system to be adequate for the regimentation of deductive reasoning in mathematics and science. We raise the question whether there are any further requirements, not entailed by these five, that ought to be imposed. One possible reply is dismissed: that the logical system should allow one to infer any proposition at all from an inconsistent set—i.e., it should have as primitive, or allow one to derive, the rule Ex Falso Quodlibet. We then propose that the logic should be implosive: it should not allow an inconsistent set to have any consequences other than absurdity. This proposal may appear to be very radical; but we hope to show that it is robust against objections.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 April 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/04/21/johannes-klubhofer/"> <h3>Using automata theory to obtain a new proof system for the modal µ-calculus</h3> <h4>Johannes Kloibhofer, ILLC, Amsterdam</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Automata theory has various applications in the theory of the modal µ-calculus. One such application is for the tableaux games for the modal µ-calculus introduced by Niwinski and Walukiewicz, in which one player has a winning strategy iff the formula is satisfiable. The winning condition of that game can be naturally checked by a nondeterministic parity automaton. We show how the determinisation of that automaton may be used to obtain a proof system.

Special attention will be paid to recent advances in the subject that indicate the distinctive character of Peano Arithmetic, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and their higher order analogues in the realm of interpretability theory.

Since the introduction by Hodges, and refinement by Väänänen, team semantic constructions have been used to generate expressively enriched logics still conserving nice properties, such as compactness or decidability. In contrast these logics fail to be substitutional, limiting any algebraic treatment, and rendering fully schematic proof systems impossible. This shortcoming can be attributed to the <em>flatness principle</em>, commonly adhered to when generating team semantics.</p> <p>Investigating the formation of team logics from an algebraic perspective, and disregarding the flatness-principle, I will present the <em>logic of teams</em> (LT), a substitutional logic for which important propositional team logics are axiomatisable as fragments. Starting from classical propositional logic and Boolean algebras, we give semantics for LT by considering algebras of the form P(B) being the powerset of a Boolean algebra B, treated with treated with an <em>internal</em> (derived from B) and an <em>external</em> (set-theoretic) set of connectives. Furthermore, we present a well-motivated labelled natural deduction system for LT, for which a further analysis motivates a generalisation to constructions of logics by combinations of an internal and an external logic, where for LT both are classical propositional logic.</p> <p>This is joint work with Fredrik Engström.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-03-10 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 10 March 2023, 10:15</time>, J412   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/02/27/sven-ove-hansson/"> <h3>How to combine probabilities and full beliefs in a formal system</h3> <h4>Sven Ove Hansson, KTH</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>One of the major problems in formal epistemology is the difficulty of combining probabilistic and full (dichotomous, all-or-nothing) beliefs in one and the same formal framework. Major properties of actual human belief systems, including how they are impacted by our cognitive limitations, are used to introduce a series of desiderata for realistic models of such belief systems. This leads to a criticism of previous attempts to combine representations of both probabilistic and full beliefs in one and the same formal model. Furthermore, a formal model is presented in which this is done differently. One of its major features is that contingent propositions can be transferred in both directions between full beliefs and lower degrees of belief, in a way that mirrors real-life acquisitions and losses of full beliefs. The subsystem consisting of full beliefs has a pattern of change that constitutes a credible system of dichotomous belief change.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-27 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 February 2023, 16:00</time>, zoom   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/02/27/fokkens-licentiate/"> <h3>Modelling the logical mind – Using the cognitive architecture ACT-R to model human symbolic reasoning in the description logic ALE</h3> <h4>Licentiate defence: Tjeerd Fokkens, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Public defence of Tjeerd Fokkens’ Licentiate thesis.</p> <p><strong>Opponent</strong> Dr Ing Stefan Borgwardt, Technische Universität Dresden<br> <strong>Examiner</strong> Professor Simon Dobnik, Göteborgs universitet</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-27 10:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 February 2023, 10:00</time>, J233   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/02/10/graham-leigh/"> <h3>Coinductive Proof Theory</h3> <h4>Graham Leigh, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>I will present recent results and work in progress on adapting proof theoretic methods to non-well-founded notions of proof.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-10 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 10 February 2023, 10:15</time>, J412   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/01/30/vann-mcgee/"> <h3>Boolean Degrees of Truth and Classical Rules of Inference</h3> <h4>Vann McGee, MIT</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Compositional semantics that acknowledge vagueness by positing degrees of truth intermediate between truth and falsity can retain classical sentential calculus, provided the degrees form a Boolean algebra.
