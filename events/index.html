The soundness of cyclic proofs is usually ensured by imposing additional conditions beyond well-formedness. Distinct cyclic representations of the same logic can be obtained by combining the same stock of logical rules with different soundness conditions.</p> <p>This thesis is a compilation of work in cyclic proof theory with a focus on the representation of cyclic proofs. The perspective is justified two-fold: First, the choice of representation of cyclic proofs has significant impact on proof theoretic investigations of cyclic proofs, dictating the effort required to derive desired results. Second, arguments which focus on the ‘cyclic’ aspects of cyclic proof systems, such as proof representations, rather than relying on specifics of logics, transfer more easily between different logics.</p> <p>This thesis makes several contributions to the field of cyclic proof theory. First, we present a method for generating reset proof systems, a representation of cyclic proofs which has previously been key to proof theoretic investigations, from cyclic proof systems with global trace conditions, by far the most common representation of cyclic proofs in the literature. Because the method is presented in a generic manner, this yields reset proof systems for most logics considered in the cyclic proof theory literature. Second, we transfer a proof method of the equivalence of cyclic and ‘inductive’ proof systems, first employed by Sprenger and Dam, to the setting of Heyting and Peano arithmetic. Whereas previous proofs of this equivalence for arithmetic theories have relied on intricate arithmetical formalisations of meta-mathematical concepts, our proof operates at the level of cyclic proof representations. Third, using insights into the aforementioned proof method, we put forward a novel form of representation for cyclic proof systems which is of interest to cyclic proof theory beyond the proving of cyclic-inductive equivalences.</p> <p>See also the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/event/licentiate-seminar-dominik-wehr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">public announcement of the event</a>.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-28 14:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 28 April 2023, 14:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/04/27/workshop-proof-theory.html"> <h3>Workshop on Fixed Points and Ill-founded Proofs</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The logic group is hosting a two-day workshop on Thursday, 27 April and Friday, 28 April.

I will focus on the general structure of such arguments, and in particular emphasise the scope of the methodology.</p> <h3 id="lide-grotenhuis-ill-founded-proofs-for-intuitionistic-linear-time-temporal-logic">Lide Grotenhuis: Ill-founded proofs for intuitionistic linear-time temporal logic</h3> <p>Ill-founded and cyclic proof calculi have shown to be particularly suitable for modal fixed point logics. The present work is motivated by the question whether such calculi can also be designed for intuitionistic versions of such logics. The main obstacle in applying the standard techniques is the two-dimensional nature of the intuitionistic semantics: Kripke models for intuitionistic modal logic consist of both an intuitionistic and a modal relation, which are required to satisfy some confluence properties.</p> <p>In this work we study intuitionistic versions of linear-time temporal logic by considering the language iLTL, which extends intuitionistic propositional logic with the temporal operators ‘next’ and ‘until’. We interpret this language in models satisfying forward confluence and models satisfying both forward and backward confluence. For each of the resulting logics, we present a cut-free complete, ill-founded sequent calculus. Both calculi employ a simple form of nesting that enables formulas to be operated on at different temporal positions. This is joint work with Bahareh Afshari, Graham Leigh and Lukas Zenger.</p> <h3 id="sebastian-enqvist-herbrand-meets-cyclic-proofs">Sebastian Enqvist: Herbrand meets cyclic proofs</h3> <p>Herbrand’s theorem provides a sort of computational content to classical logic. A standard way to prove it uses cut elimination in sequent calculus. In recent work by Afshari, Hetzl and Leigh, it was shown how to extract Herbrand disjunctions directly from sequent calculus proofs without eliminating cuts first. The idea is to associate a higher-order recursion scheme with a given proof, from which a set of witnessing terms can be extracted. In this talk I will present ongoing work, joint with Bahareh Afshari and Graham Leigh, in which we show how such “Herbrand schemes” can be adapted to provide a method for witness extraction from cyclic sequent calculus proofs in the setting of the classical theory of inductively defined predicates. Indeed, this is a quite natural step to take, as recursion schemes in general are cyclic structures.</p> <h3 id="johannes-kloibhofer-cut-elimination-in-cyclic-proofs-for-temporal-logic">Johannes Kloibhofer: Cut elimination in cyclic proofs for temporal logic</h3> <p>We present cut elimination for an annotated cyclic proof system for modal logic with the eventually operator. In this proof system the usual method of pushing cuts upwards does not necessarily yield a proof. We circumvent this problem by separating the critical case in the cut reductions, enabling us to directly obtain a cut-free cyclic proof without a detour via infinitary proofs. We expect that this method can be extended to more complicated logics and thereby serve as a starting point for developing cut elimination methods for cyclic proof systems.</p> <p>(joint work in progress with Bahareh Afshari)</p> <h3 id="gianluca-curzi-on-the-computational-expressivity-of-circular-proofs-with-fixed-points">Gianluca Curzi: On the computational expressivity of (circular) proofs with fixed points</h3> <p>We study the computational expressivity of proof systems with fixed point operators, within the ‘proofs-as-programs’ paradigm. We start with a calculus muLJ (due to Clairambault) that extends intuitionistic logic by least and greatest positive fixed points. Based in the sequent calculus, muLJ admits an extension to a ‘circular’ calculus CmuLJ in a standard way.</p> <p>Our main result is that, perhaps surprisingly, both muLJ and CmuLJ represent the same first-order functions: those provably total in Pi12-CA0, a subsystem of second-order arithmetic beyond the ‘big five’ of reverse mathematics and one of the strongest theories for which we have an ordinal analysis (due to Rathjen). This solves various questions in the literature on the computational strength of (circular) proof systems with fixed points.</p> <p>For the lower bound we give a realisability interpretation from an extension of Peano Arithmetic by fixed points that has been shown to be arithmetically equivalent to Pi12-CA0 (due to Möllerfeld). For the upper bound we give a novel totality argument for circular proofs with fixed points. In fact we must formalise this argument itself within Pi12-CA0 in order to obtain the tight bounds we are after, requiring a choice of higher computability model distinct from usual type structures for second-order systems (such as Girard-Reynolds’ F). Along the way we develop some novel reverse mathematics for the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-27 00:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Thursday, 27 April 2023, 00:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/02/27/fokkens-licentiate.html"> <h3>Modelling the logical mind – Using the cognitive architecture ACT-R to model human symbolic reasoning in the description logic ALE</h3> <h4>Licentiate defence: Tjeerd Fokkens (FLoV)</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>Public defence of Tjeerd Fokkens’ Licentiate thesis.</p> <p><strong>Opponent</strong> Dr Ing Stefan Borgwardt, Technische Universität Dresden<br> <strong>Examiner</strong> Professor Simon Dobnik, Göteborgs universitet</p> </div></summary> <p>The problem of optimising automated explanations for entailments in knowledge bases is tackled by modelling deductive reasoning processes using the cognitive architecture ACT-R.

Common to both research strands is a method for dealing with the iterative nature of fixed points. In the first part the interest is directed to a cyclic system ICA for intuitionistic arithmetic. The formal definition of the system is followed by the introduction of typed λY-calculus, whose terms represent the deductive process of cyclic proofs. A method for producing recursion schemes from instances of cyclic proofs is given. The result is a grammar whose language consists of λ-terms, capturing the computational content implicit in the initial proof. In the second part, we look at the iteration of fixed points in terms of closure ordinals of formulas in the modal μ-calculus. A method for determining an upper bound on closure ordinals is presented and applied to formulas in fragments of the Σ1 class, with results that are in line with the already existing works. Annotated structures, to track how model changes affect the ordinals, and a pumping technique for these structures are the main tools used to establish an upper bound.</p> <p>A copy of Giacomo’s thesis can be obtained by sending an email to the contact person <a href="">Bahareh Afshari</a>.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-12-20 09:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Tuesday, 20 December 2022, 09:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2022/09/30/departmental-conference.html"> <h3>Departmental Conference</h3> <h4>Departmental Conference (no logic seminar)</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-09-30 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 30 September 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2022/09/15/clasp-conference.html"> <h3>Clasp Conference</h3> <h4>CLASP Conference on (Dis)embodiment</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>(Dis)embodiment is a conference organized by the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/clasp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP)</a>, at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science.

How far is a truth theory from its base? Abstract. In the first part of the talk, I will review some basic results about conservativity and interpretability of truth theories in relation to their base theory. In the second part, I will report on recent joint work with Mateusz Łełyk and Bartosz Wcisło on feasible proof- theoretic reduction of the following theories to PA: (1) Compositional truth over PA (with no extra induction); (2) Friedman-Sheard truth over PA (with no extra induction); and (3) Kripke-Feferman truth over PA (with no extra induction).</p> <h3 id="thursday">Thursday:</h3> <p>10:15. Bartosz Wcisło (Warsaw).</p> <p>11:15. Mattias Olsson (Gothenburg). Constructive truth + open discussion Abstract. The result that intuitionistic ID1-hat, and in particular its subtheory intuitionistic KF, is conservative over Heyting arithmetic (HA) has apparently been folklore for some time, though it seems to have been proved only quite recently in a series of papers by Buchholz, Rüede and Strahm, and Arai. After a motivational digression into classical logic we present work in progress on a proposal for a different proof of this result, or a substantial part of it, based on realisability in HA. The idea is to show that every theorem of ID1-hat has a realiser and that realisability is disquotational for certain classes of formulae.</p> <p>13:15. Cezary Cieśliński (Warsaw). Satisfaction classes via cut elimination Abstract. The objective is to present a fully classical construction of a satisfaction class for the language of first-order arithmetic. In the construction, we will be using cut elimination as the fundamental proof technique. The main challenge is to modify the cut elimination method in such a way that it can be applied to a proof system processing possibly non- standard arithmetical formulas.</p> <p>14:45. Anton Broberg (Gothenburg). FS &amp; co-Nec Abstract. It is an open question whether the rule CONEC (Co-Necessitaion) is superfluous in Friedman and Sheard’s system FS. We will present a proof-sketch that answer this question positively. First the problem is reduced by showing that we can put some restrictions on the proofs of FS without limiting the strength of FS. Then this reduced problem is shown via ordinal analysis on a system formulated in an infinitary proof calculus. This is joint work with G. Leigh and is very much in progress.</p> <p>15:45. Mateusz Łełyk (Warsaw). Finite axiomatizability via the compositional truth predicate Abstract. Occasionally in the literature one can find the claim that the easiest way to find a finite axiomatization of an extension Th of PA is to consider CT−(Th) (extension of Th with the Tarski-style compositional axioms for the newly added truth predicate) and add the sentence saying “All axioms of Th are true”. We show that this claim is false as there are very natural arithmetical theories Th for which CT−(Th)+ “All axioms of Th are true.” is non-conservative over Th. Then we show that for every r.e. theory Th there exists a recursive axiomatization A such that CT−(Th)+ “All sentences from A are true.” is conservative over Th. Then we study the question: which theories Th are the arithmetical parts of CT−(PA)+ “All sentences from A are true.”, where A is an axiomatization of PA which is proof-theoretically reducible to (the standard axiomatization of) PA.</p> <p>17:00.

Specifically, ZFC proves the set is finite; the definition φ has complexity Σ₂ and therefore any instance of it φ(x) is locally verifiable inside any sufficiently large V~θ~; the set is empty in any transitive model; and if φ defines the set y in some countable model M of ZFC and y ⊂ z for some finite set z in M, then there is a top-extension of M to a model N of ZFC in which φ(x) defines the new set z. I shall draw out consequences of the universal finite set for set-theoretic potentialism and discuss several issues it raises in the philosophy of set theory.<br> The talk will include joint work with W.

Although satisfiable systems of higher-order clauses in the standard semantics do not generally have least models, by viewing these systems as a kind of monotone logic programs, we show that there are non-standard semantics that do satisfy the least model property. Moreover the respective satisfiability problems in the standard and non-standard semantics are inter-reducible. With a view to exploiting the remarkable efficiency of SMT solvers, we survey recent developments in the algorithmic solution of higher-order Horn systems by reduction to first order, and discuss related problems.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Public Lindström Lecture on Monday: <em>Progressions of theories and slow consistency</em><br> The fact that “natural” theories, i.e. theories which have something like an “idea” to them, are almost always linearly ordered with regard to logical strength has been called one of the great mysteries of the foundation of mathematics. Using paradoxical methods, e.g. self-reference Rosser-style, one can distill theories with incomparable logical strengths and show that the degree structure of logical strengths is dense in that between two theories S &lt; T one can always find a third Q such that S &lt; Q &lt; T . But are there “natural” examples of such phenomena? We also know how to produce a stronger theory by adding the consistency of the theory. Can we get a stronger theory by adding something weaker than consistency that is still “natural”? These and other questions will be broached in the talk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Research Lindström Lecture on Wednesday: <em>Bounds for the strength of the graph minor and the immersion theorem</em><br> The graph minor theorem, GM, is arguably the most important theorem of graph theory. The strength of GM exceeds that of the standard classification systems of RM known as the “big five”. The plan is to survey the current knowledge about the strength of GM and other Kruskal-like principles, presenting lower and upper bounds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Katrin Tent</strong> (Münster): <em>Ampleness in strongly minimal structures</em><br> The notion of ampleness captures essential properties of projective spaces over fields. It is natural to ask whether any sufficiently ample strongly minimal set arises from an algebraically closed field. In this talk I will explain the question and survey recent results on ample strongly minimal structures.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/assets/18-sls/book_of_abstracts_sls2018.pdf">programme and book of abstracts</a> is available as a pdf.</p> <h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3> <p>The <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/assets/18-sls/programme_sls2018.pdf">schedule for the symposium</a> is available as a pdf.</p> <h3 id="registration">Registration</h3> <p>To register please use the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/EWuYIeJmK8cADn9v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">registration form</a>.

As all of us know, logical consequence is about what follows from what. But this seemingly unambiguous, albeit vague, characterization does become ambiguous when one starts thinking in terms of information flow. One may ask what follows from the information possessed, or what follows from the information received. I will make these notions precise in a dynamic framework and discuss the relationships between them, in particular when the information is represented within Dynamic Epistemic Logic.</p> <p><strong>Robin Cooper</strong> <em>Quantifiers and the nature of intensionality</em><br> I will discuss the intensional quantifiers and suggest that the kind of intensionality involved is not quite the same as that we need for attitude reports. I will suggest a way to approach this situation using a type theoretical analysis of generalized quantifiers.</p> <p><strong>Lauri Hella</strong> <em>Generalized quantifiers and logics with built-in relations</em><br> Built-in relations have an important role in descriptive complexity theory: for example, the famous Immerman-Vardi characterization of PTIME by Least Fixed Point Logic is only valid in the presence of built-in linear order. Similarly, all the known logical characterizations of circuit complexity classes require the presence of built-in artithmetical relations. However, a general theory of abstract logics and generalized quantifiers with built-in relations has been lacking up to now. In this talk, I describe an approach towards developing such a theory. The talk is based on joint work with Juha Kontinen and Kerkko Luosto.</p> <p><strong>Peter Pagin</strong> <em>Compositionality by currying</em><br> Suppose that we have a semantics μ that gives values for expressions of a language L at evaluation points. If L contains operators that shift evaluation points (an example is quantifiers in first-order logic with assignments as points), μ may not be compositional. But if μ is compositional for the shifting-operator-free fragment, then the curried semantics μ* will be compositional, where μ* gives values to expressions that are functions from evaluation points to the values of μ. I plan to take a first look at how this works for the semantics of second-order logic, and its relation to the semantics for games of imperfect information, as given by Hodges.</p> <p><strong>Stanley Peters</strong> <em>Descriptive Quantifiers</em><br> Natural languages employ a number of type &lt;1,1&gt; quantifiers that are not invariant under isomorphism because the quantification they express is partly determined by a descriptive element. Examples include possessives such as Mary’s and exceptives like no __ except Sunnis. Like isomorphism invariant ones, these quantifiers can be rigorously analyzed logically, provided due attention is given to the role played by their descriptive elements. Joint work with Dag has shown that the analytic process often brings out linguistically significant features of descriptive quantifiers that were not previously recognized.</p> <p><strong>Jouko Väänänen</strong> <em>Foundational and model theoretic aspects of second order logic</em><br> I formulate a “second order logic view”, an approach to foundations of mathematics giving second order logic a dominant role, and compare it with what I call “set theory view”. I give some model theoretic results about second order logic and discuss their implications to the “second order logic view”, and to the concept of second order logic in general.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2013-05-03 00:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 3 May 2013, 00:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Graham E.
