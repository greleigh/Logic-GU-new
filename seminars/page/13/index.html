In this lecture, I will develop the dynamic perspective, showing how key aspects of rational agency fit in the agenda of logic, such as handling and integrating information from various sources, revising erroneous beliefs, and balancing information with preferences and goals. In this lecture, the vehicle for achieving this will be dynamic-epistemic logics for various sorts of update. These mesh eventually with richer logics of games and strategic interaction. After all, much of reasoning is a social multi-agent process: ‘intelligence seldom comes alone’. I end this part by noting how the two faces of logic share the same methodology, and are in fact complementary.</p> <p>However, ‘more logic’ is just one way to go in studying agency. I briefly discuss current challenges from the ‘less logic’ camp, where successful behavior is explained by dynamical systems with very simple agents, or from learning systems that may not have a logical formulation at all. I hope to show that logic retains a valuable role even in that stormy setting.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2019-11-20 19:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Wednesday, 20 November 2019, 19:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures">Lindström Lectures</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2019 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/Gothenburg-Warsaw-Truth-Workshop/"> <h3>Gothenburg–Warsaw Workshop on Truth</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The Gothenburg–Warsaw workshop on truth was held on Thursday, 6 December 2018 at the <a href="https://www.gu.se/flov" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science</a> at the University of Gothenburg.

How far is a truth theory from its base? Abstract. In the first part of the talk, I will review some basic results about conservativity and interpretability of truth theories in relation to their base theory. In the second part, I will report on recent joint work with Mateusz Łełyk and Bartosz Wcisło on feasible proof- theoretic reduction of the following theories to PA: (1) Compositional truth over PA (with no extra induction); (2) Friedman-Sheard truth over PA (with no extra induction); and (3) Kripke-Feferman truth over PA (with no extra induction).</p> <h3 id="thursday">Thursday:</h3> <p>10:15. Bartosz Wcisło (Warsaw).</p> <p>11:15. Mattias Olsson (Gothenburg). Constructive truth + open discussion Abstract. The result that intuitionistic ID1-hat, and in particular its subtheory intuitionistic KF, is conservative over Heyting arithmetic (HA) has apparently been folklore for some time, though it seems to have been proved only quite recently in a series of papers by Buchholz, Rüede and Strahm, and Arai. After a motivational digression into classical logic we present work in progress on a proposal for a different proof of this result, or a substantial part of it, based on realisability in HA. The idea is to show that every theorem of ID1-hat has a realiser and that realisability is disquotational for certain classes of formulae.</p> <p>13:15. Cezary Cieśliński (Warsaw). Satisfaction classes via cut elimination Abstract. The objective is to present a fully classical construction of a satisfaction class for the language of first-order arithmetic. In the construction, we will be using cut elimination as the fundamental proof technique. The main challenge is to modify the cut elimination method in such a way that it can be applied to a proof system processing possibly non- standard arithmetical formulas.</p> <p>14:45. Anton Broberg (Gothenburg). FS &amp; co-Nec Abstract. It is an open question whether the rule CONEC (Co-Necessitaion) is superfluous in Friedman and Sheard’s system FS. We will present a proof-sketch that answer this question positively. First the problem is reduced by showing that we can put some restrictions on the proofs of FS without limiting the strength of FS. Then this reduced problem is shown via ordinal analysis on a system formulated in an infinitary proof calculus. This is joint work with G. Leigh and is very much in progress.</p> <p>15:45. Mateusz Łełyk (Warsaw). Finite axiomatizability via the compositional truth predicate Abstract. Occasionally in the literature one can find the claim that the easiest way to find a finite axiomatization of an extension Th of PA is to consider CT−(Th) (extension of Th with the Tarski-style compositional axioms for the newly added truth predicate) and add the sentence saying “All axioms of Th are true”. We show that this claim is false as there are very natural arithmetical theories Th for which CT−(Th)+ “All axioms of Th are true.” is non-conservative over Th. Then we show that for every r.e. theory Th there exists a recursive axiomatization A such that CT−(Th)+ “All sentences from A are true.” is conservative over Th. Then we study the question: which theories Th are the arithmetical parts of CT−(PA)+ “All sentences from A are true.”, where A is an axiomatization of PA which is proof-theoretically reducible to (the standard axiomatization of) PA.</p> <p>17:00.

Specifically, ZFC proves the set is finite; the definition φ has complexity Σ₂ and therefore any instance of it φ(x) is locally verifiable inside any sufficiently large V~θ~; the set is empty in any transitive model; and if φ defines the set y in some countable model M of ZFC and y ⊂ z for some finite set z in M, then there is a top-extension of M to a model N of ZFC in which φ(x) defines the new set z. I shall draw out consequences of the universal finite set for set-theoretic potentialism and discuss several issues it raises in the philosophy of set theory.<br> The talk will include joint work with W.

Although satisfiable systems of higher-order clauses in the standard semantics do not generally have least models, by viewing these systems as a kind of monotone logic programs, we show that there are non-standard semantics that do satisfy the least model property. Moreover the respective satisfiability problems in the standard and non-standard semantics are inter-reducible. With a view to exploiting the remarkable efficiency of SMT solvers, we survey recent developments in the algorithmic solution of higher-order Horn systems by reduction to first order, and discuss related problems.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Public Lindström Lecture on Monday: <em>Progressions of theories and slow consistency</em><br> The fact that “natural” theories, i.e. theories which have something like an “idea” to them, are almost always linearly ordered with regard to logical strength has been called one of the great mysteries of the foundation of mathematics. Using paradoxical methods, e.g. self-reference Rosser-style, one can distill theories with incomparable logical strengths and show that the degree structure of logical strengths is dense in that between two theories S &lt; T one can always find a third Q such that S &lt; Q &lt; T . But are there “natural” examples of such phenomena? We also know how to produce a stronger theory by adding the consistency of the theory. Can we get a stronger theory by adding something weaker than consistency that is still “natural”? These and other questions will be broached in the talk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Research Lindström Lecture on Wednesday: <em>Bounds for the strength of the graph minor and the immersion theorem</em><br> The graph minor theorem, GM, is arguably the most important theorem of graph theory. The strength of GM exceeds that of the standard classification systems of RM known as the “big five”. The plan is to survey the current knowledge about the strength of GM and other Kruskal-like principles, presenting lower and upper bounds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Katrin Tent</strong> (Münster): <em>Ampleness in strongly minimal structures</em><br> The notion of ampleness captures essential properties of projective spaces over fields. It is natural to ask whether any sufficiently ample strongly minimal set arises from an algebraically closed field. In this talk I will explain the question and survey recent results on ample strongly minimal structures.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/assets/18-sls/book_of_abstracts_sls2018.pdf">programme and book of abstracts</a> is available as a pdf.</p> <h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3> <p>The <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/assets/18-sls/programme_sls2018.pdf">schedule for the symposium</a> is available as a pdf.</p> <h3 id="registration">Registration</h3> <p>To register please use the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/EWuYIeJmK8cADn9v1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">registration form</a>.

As all of us know, logical consequence is about what follows from what. But this seemingly unambiguous, albeit vague, characterization does become ambiguous when one starts thinking in terms of information flow. One may ask what follows from the information possessed, or what follows from the information received. I will make these notions precise in a dynamic framework and discuss the relationships between them, in particular when the information is represented within Dynamic Epistemic Logic.</p> <p><strong>Robin Cooper</strong> <em>Quantifiers and the nature of intensionality</em><br> I will discuss the intensional quantifiers and suggest that the kind of intensionality involved is not quite the same as that we need for attitude reports. I will suggest a way to approach this situation using a type theoretical analysis of generalized quantifiers.</p> <p><strong>Lauri Hella</strong> <em>Generalized quantifiers and logics with built-in relations</em><br> Built-in relations have an important role in descriptive complexity theory: for example, the famous Immerman-Vardi characterization of PTIME by Least Fixed Point Logic is only valid in the presence of built-in linear order. Similarly, all the known logical characterizations of circuit complexity classes require the presence of built-in artithmetical relations. However, a general theory of abstract logics and generalized quantifiers with built-in relations has been lacking up to now. In this talk, I describe an approach towards developing such a theory. The talk is based on joint work with Juha Kontinen and Kerkko Luosto.</p> <p><strong>Peter Pagin</strong> <em>Compositionality by currying</em><br> Suppose that we have a semantics μ that gives values for expressions of a language L at evaluation points. If L contains operators that shift evaluation points (an example is quantifiers in first-order logic with assignments as points), μ may not be compositional. But if μ is compositional for the shifting-operator-free fragment, then the curried semantics μ* will be compositional, where μ* gives values to expressions that are functions from evaluation points to the values of μ. I plan to take a first look at how this works for the semantics of second-order logic, and its relation to the semantics for games of imperfect information, as given by Hodges.</p> <p><strong>Stanley Peters</strong> <em>Descriptive Quantifiers</em><br> Natural languages employ a number of type &lt;1,1&gt; quantifiers that are not invariant under isomorphism because the quantification they express is partly determined by a descriptive element. Examples include possessives such as Mary’s and exceptives like no __ except Sunnis. Like isomorphism invariant ones, these quantifiers can be rigorously analyzed logically, provided due attention is given to the role played by their descriptive elements. Joint work with Dag has shown that the analytic process often brings out linguistically significant features of descriptive quantifiers that were not previously recognized.</p> <p><strong>Jouko Väänänen</strong> <em>Foundational and model theoretic aspects of second order logic</em><br> I formulate a “second order logic view”, an approach to foundations of mathematics giving second order logic a dominant role, and compare it with what I call “set theory view”. I give some model theoretic results about second order logic and discuss their implications to the “second order logic view”, and to the concept of second order logic in general.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2013-05-03 00:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 3 May 2013, 00:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> </ul> <nav aria-label="Blog page naviation"> <ul class="pagination pagination-lg justify-content-center"> <li class="page-item "> <a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/12/" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="12">Newer</a> </li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/9/index.html" title="Seminars - page 9">9</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/10/index.html" title="Seminars - page 10">10</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/11/index.html" title="Seminars - page 11">11</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/12/index.html" title="Seminars - page 12">12</a></li> <li class="page-item active"><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/13/index.html" title="Seminars - page 13">13</a></li> <li class="page-item disabled"> <a class="page-link" href="">Older</a> </li> </ul> </nav> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Graham E.
