There are, however, interesting non-normal logics that are not, but which nevertheless satisfy a weak form of conjunctive closure. One example is a notion of group knowledge in epistemic logic: somebody-knows. While something is general knowledge if it is known by <em>everyone</em>, this notion holds if it is known by <em>someone</em>. Somebody-knows is thus weaker than general knowledge but stronger than distributed knowledge. We introduce a modality for somebody-knows in the style of standard group knowledge modalities, and study its properties. Unlike most other group knowledge modalities, somebody-knows is not a normal modality; in particular it lacks the conjunctive closure property. We provide an equivalent neighbourhood semantics for the language with a single somebody-knows modality, together with a completeness result: the somebody-knows modalities are completely characterised by the modal logic EMN extended with a particular weak conjunctive closure axiom. The neighbourhood semantics and the completeness and complexity results also carry over other logics with weak conjunctive closure, including the logic of so-called local reasoning (Fagin et al., 1995) with bounded “frames of mind”, correcting an existing completeness result in the literature (Allen 2005). The talk is based on joint work with Yi N. Wang.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-08-28 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 28 August 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/05/26/raheleh-jalali.html"> <h3>General form of rules implies feasible admissibility</h3> <h4>Raheleh Jalali (Czech Academy of Sciences)</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>In this talk, we introduce a general family of sequent-style calculi over the modal language and its fragments to capture the essence of all constructively acceptable systems. Calling these calculi constructive, we show that any strong enough constructive sequent calculus, satisfying a mild technical condition, feasibly admits all Visser’s rules, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm that reads a proof of the premise of a Visser’s rule and provides a proof for its conclusion. As a positive application, we show the feasible admissibility of Visser’s rules in several sequent calculi for intuitionistic modal logics, including CK, IK and their extensions by the modal axioms T, B, 4, 5, the modal axioms of bounded width and depth and the propositional lax logic. On the negative side, we show that if a strong enough intuitionistic modal logic (satisfying a mild technical condition) does not admit at least one of Visser’s rules, then it cannot have a constructive sequent calculus. Consequently, no intermediate logic other than IPC has a constructive sequent calculus.

In this paper, we give a brief introduction to SHACL tailored towards logicians and frame key uses of SHACL as familiar logic reasoning tasks. We discuss how SHACL relates to description logics, which are the basis of the OWL Web Ontology Languages, a related yet orthogonal standard for web data.

In the proofs, we use a combinatorial result by Kleitman and Rothschild about the structure of finite (strict) partial orders: almost all of them consist of only three layers. Finally, we present empirical results in order to give an idea of the number of elements from which onwards a formula’s almost sure validity or almost sure invalidity stabilizes in such three-layer Kleitman-Rothschild frames.

The soundness of cyclic proofs is usually ensured by imposing additional conditions beyond well-formedness. Distinct cyclic representations of the same logic can be obtained by combining the same stock of logical rules with different soundness conditions.</p> <p>This thesis is a compilation of work in cyclic proof theory with a focus on the representation of cyclic proofs. The perspective is justified two-fold: First, the choice of representation of cyclic proofs has significant impact on proof theoretic investigations of cyclic proofs, dictating the effort required to derive desired results. Second, arguments which focus on the ‘cyclic’ aspects of cyclic proof systems, such as proof representations, rather than relying on specifics of logics, transfer more easily between different logics.</p> <p>This thesis makes several contributions to the field of cyclic proof theory. First, we present a method for generating reset proof systems, a representation of cyclic proofs which has previously been key to proof theoretic investigations, from cyclic proof systems with global trace conditions, by far the most common representation of cyclic proofs in the literature. Because the method is presented in a generic manner, this yields reset proof systems for most logics considered in the cyclic proof theory literature. Second, we transfer a proof method of the equivalence of cyclic and ‘inductive’ proof systems, first employed by Sprenger and Dam, to the setting of Heyting and Peano arithmetic. Whereas previous proofs of this equivalence for arithmetic theories have relied on intricate arithmetical formalisations of meta-mathematical concepts, our proof operates at the level of cyclic proof representations. Third, using insights into the aforementioned proof method, we put forward a novel form of representation for cyclic proof systems which is of interest to cyclic proof theory beyond the proving of cyclic-inductive equivalences.</p> <p>See also the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/event/licentiate-seminar-dominik-wehr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">public announcement of the event</a>.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-28 14:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 28 April 2023, 14:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/04/27/workshop-proof-theory.html"> <h3>Workshop on Fixed Points and Ill-founded Proofs</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The logic group is hosting a two-day workshop on Thursday, 27 April and Friday, 28 April.

I will focus on the general structure of such arguments, and in particular emphasise the scope of the methodology.</p> <h3 id="lide-grotenhuis-ill-founded-proofs-for-intuitionistic-linear-time-temporal-logic">Lide Grotenhuis: Ill-founded proofs for intuitionistic linear-time temporal logic</h3> <p>Ill-founded and cyclic proof calculi have shown to be particularly suitable for modal fixed point logics. The present work is motivated by the question whether such calculi can also be designed for intuitionistic versions of such logics. The main obstacle in applying the standard techniques is the two-dimensional nature of the intuitionistic semantics: Kripke models for intuitionistic modal logic consist of both an intuitionistic and a modal relation, which are required to satisfy some confluence properties.</p> <p>In this work we study intuitionistic versions of linear-time temporal logic by considering the language iLTL, which extends intuitionistic propositional logic with the temporal operators ‘next’ and ‘until’. We interpret this language in models satisfying forward confluence and models satisfying both forward and backward confluence. For each of the resulting logics, we present a cut-free complete, ill-founded sequent calculus. Both calculi employ a simple form of nesting that enables formulas to be operated on at different temporal positions. This is joint work with Bahareh Afshari, Graham Leigh and Lukas Zenger.</p> <h3 id="sebastian-enqvist-herbrand-meets-cyclic-proofs">Sebastian Enqvist: Herbrand meets cyclic proofs</h3> <p>Herbrand’s theorem provides a sort of computational content to classical logic. A standard way to prove it uses cut elimination in sequent calculus. In recent work by Afshari, Hetzl and Leigh, it was shown how to extract Herbrand disjunctions directly from sequent calculus proofs without eliminating cuts first. The idea is to associate a higher-order recursion scheme with a given proof, from which a set of witnessing terms can be extracted. In this talk I will present ongoing work, joint with Bahareh Afshari and Graham Leigh, in which we show how such “Herbrand schemes” can be adapted to provide a method for witness extraction from cyclic sequent calculus proofs in the setting of the classical theory of inductively defined predicates. Indeed, this is a quite natural step to take, as recursion schemes in general are cyclic structures.</p> <h3 id="johannes-kloibhofer-cut-elimination-in-cyclic-proofs-for-temporal-logic">Johannes Kloibhofer: Cut elimination in cyclic proofs for temporal logic</h3> <p>We present cut elimination for an annotated cyclic proof system for modal logic with the eventually operator. In this proof system the usual method of pushing cuts upwards does not necessarily yield a proof. We circumvent this problem by separating the critical case in the cut reductions, enabling us to directly obtain a cut-free cyclic proof without a detour via infinitary proofs. We expect that this method can be extended to more complicated logics and thereby serve as a starting point for developing cut elimination methods for cyclic proof systems.</p> <p>(joint work in progress with Bahareh Afshari)</p> <h3 id="gianluca-curzi-on-the-computational-expressivity-of-circular-proofs-with-fixed-points">Gianluca Curzi: On the computational expressivity of (circular) proofs with fixed points</h3> <p>We study the computational expressivity of proof systems with fixed point operators, within the ‘proofs-as-programs’ paradigm. We start with a calculus muLJ (due to Clairambault) that extends intuitionistic logic by least and greatest positive fixed points. Based in the sequent calculus, muLJ admits an extension to a ‘circular’ calculus CmuLJ in a standard way.</p> <p>Our main result is that, perhaps surprisingly, both muLJ and CmuLJ represent the same first-order functions: those provably total in Pi12-CA0, a subsystem of second-order arithmetic beyond the ‘big five’ of reverse mathematics and one of the strongest theories for which we have an ordinal analysis (due to Rathjen). This solves various questions in the literature on the computational strength of (circular) proof systems with fixed points.</p> <p>For the lower bound we give a realisability interpretation from an extension of Peano Arithmetic by fixed points that has been shown to be arithmetically equivalent to Pi12-CA0 (due to Möllerfeld). For the upper bound we give a novel totality argument for circular proofs with fixed points. In fact we must formalise this argument itself within Pi12-CA0 in order to obtain the tight bounds we are after, requiring a choice of higher computability model distinct from usual type structures for second-order systems (such as Girard-Reynolds’ F). Along the way we develop some novel reverse mathematics for the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-27 00:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Thursday, 27 April 2023, 00:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> </ul> <nav aria-label="Blog page naviation"> <ul class="pagination pagination-lg justify-content-center"> <li class="page-item "> <a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/3/" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="3">Newer</a> </li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/3/index.html" title="Seminars - page 3">3</a></li> <li class="page-item active"><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/4/index.html" title="Seminars - page 4">4</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/5/index.html" title="Seminars - page 5">5</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/6/index.html" title="Seminars - page 6">6</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/7/index.html" title="Seminars - page 7">7</a></li> <li class="page-item "> <a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/page/5/">Older</a> </li> </ul> </nav> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Graham E.
