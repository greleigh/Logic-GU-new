To be sure, this method includes formal logic as one of its parts, but formal logic is by no means the crucial part. In fact, if, as I intend to show, the main aim of medieval Aristotelian logic is to provide methods for knowledge production and distribution, so its crucial parts are the methods for scientific proof provided in commentaries on Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics and Topics.</p> </div></summary> <p>In the first part of the presentation, I argue for the possibility of talking of medieval ‘science’, ‘scientific knowledge’, and ‘scientific method’ from a modern perspective, and discuss how the modern perspective relates to the Latin ‘scientia’ in its different senses. In the second part, I show the progression from Nicholas of Paris (1240s) and Albert the Great (1250s), who see Aristotelian logic as a systematic scientific method where syllogistic argument is fundamental, but who struggle to coherently organize it around syllogistic argument, to Radulphus Brito (1290s) who, still seeing Aristotelian logic as scientific method, uses the notion of ‘second intention’ in order to coherently structure it around syllogistic argument.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2024-05-27 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 May 2024, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/24a%20vt/2024/05/17/orvar-lorimer-olsson/"> <h3>Logics of Power-Algebras: the Boolean case</h3> <h4>Orvar Lorimer Olsson, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>Using semantics based on algebras commonplace in the study of logics, however this usage can take forms: Many-valued logics are commonly described in terms of valuations into a single algebra of truth values, whereas other treatments concern full classes of algebraic structures such as varieties defined by equation theories. This has given rise to similar constructions within different fields of study, but where the direct connections may not to be fully spelled out.</p> </div></summary> <p>Working from the many-valued perspective, in [1], by lifting the consideration of valuations into subsets of an algebra, Priest defines what he calls the plurivalent version of a logic. This process essentially constitutes taking the power-algebra of truth values from the original logic, as described by Brink [2], together with a conservative choice of truth condition inherited from the original algerba essentially through member-hood statements of specific elements. In the simplest example of this construction Priest can identify some well known multivalued logics as plurivalent logics on classical truth values of the two valued Boolean algebra [1]. However this identification fails if the construction was conducted on any other than this specific Boolean algebra.</p> <p>Continuing work towards general methods for logics with team semantics [3] I will in this presentation consider the power-algebras of arbitrary Boolean algebras and establish a sound and complete labelled natural deduction system for entailments of member-hood statements. This gives rise to the definition and presentation of logics that can be viewed as sub-structural versions of the referred many-valued logics with proof systems for which additional rules can be added to obtain the original logic.</p> <p>We will finish by reflecting on the achieved construction, and consider how it can be generalised from the class of Boolean Algebras to constructing logics based on other equational classes of algebras.</p> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <ol> <li>Graham Priest, Plurivalent logics, The Australasian Journal of Logic, vol. 11 (2014), no. 1.</li> <li>Chris Brink, Power structures, Algebra Universalis, vol. 30 (1993), pp. 177–216.</li> <li>Fredrik Engström, Orvar Lorimer Olsson, The propositional logic of teams, arXiv preprint, (2023), arXiv.2303.14022</li> </ol> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2024-05-17 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 17 May 2024, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 24a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/24a%20vt/2024/05/03/ivan-di-liberti/"> <h3>Is Kripke semantics somewhat canonical?</h3> <h4>Ivan Di Liberti, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The talk reports on an ongoing conversation with Graham Leigh on the topic of completeness theorem for modal logics, and more generally on the exploration of their semantics.

Kolaitis, University of California Santa Cruz and IBM Research</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>A classical result by Lovász asserts that two graphs G and H are isomorphic if and only if they have the same left profile, that is, for every graph F, the number of homomorphisms from F to G coincides with the number of homomorphisms from F to H. A similar result is also known to hold for right profiles, that is, two graphs G and H are isomorphic if and only if for every graph F, the number of homomorphisms from G to F coincides with the number of homomorphisms from H to F. During the past several years, there has been a study of equivalence relations that are relaxations of isomorphism obtained by restricting the left profile or the right profile to suitably restricted classes of graphs, instead of the class of all graphs. Furthermore, a notion of a query algorithm based on homomorphism counts was recently introduced and investigated. The aim of this talk is to present an overview of some of the main results in this area with emphasis on the differences between left homomorphism counts and right homomorphism counts.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2024-04-17 10:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Wednesday, 17 April 2024, 10:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2024 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/2024/2024/04/15/phokian-kolaitis-public/"> <h3>Characterizing Rule-based Languages</h3> <h4>Phokion G. Kolaitis, University of California Santa Cruz and IBM Research</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>There is a mature body of work in logic aiming to characterize logical formalisms in terms of their structural or model-theoretic properties. The origins of this work can be traced to Alfred Tarski’s program to characterize metamathematical notions in “purely mathematical terms” and to Per Lindström’s abstract characterizations of first-order logic. For the past forty years, rule-based logical languages have been widely used in databases and in related areas of computer science to express integrity constraints and to specify transformations in data management tasks, such as data exchange and ontology-based data access. The aim of this talk is to present an overview of more recent results that characterize various classes of rule-based logical languages in terms of their structural or model-theoretic properties.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2024-04-15 18:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 15 April 2024, 18:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2024 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2024/03/25/albert-visser/"> <h3>Restricted Sequential Theories</h3> <h4>Albert Visser, Utrecht University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p><em>Sequential theories</em> form a fundamental class of theories in logic. They have full coding possibilities and allow us to build partial satisfaction predicates for formulas of bounded depth-of-quantifier-alernations. In many respects, they are the proper domain of Gödelian metamathematics. We explain the notion of sequential theory.</p> <p>A theory is <em>restricted</em> if it can be axiomatised by axioms of bounded depth-of-quantifier-alernations. All finitely axiomatised theories are restriced, but, for example, also Primitive Recursive Arithmetic. We explain the small-is-very-small principle for restricted sequential theories which says that, whenever the given theory shows that a definable property has a small witness, i.e., a witness in a sufficiently small definable cut, then it shows that the property has a very small witness, i.e., a witness below a given standard number.</p> <p>We sketch two proofs that restricted theories are incomplete (however complex the axiom set).

Later, Ghilardi and Zawadowski have worked out a semantic proof of this by developing a sheaf representation of finitely presented Heyting algebras. The basic idea is to represent a Heyting algebra via its collection of models on finite Kripke frames, expressed in a suitable categorical and sheaf-theoretic language. Their representation allows them to show, among other things, that the algebraic theory of Heyting algebras has a model companion, and the quantifier elimination result also follows as a consequence. In this talk, I will briefly recall these classical result and show the possibility of extending these developments to a suitable class of first-order intuitionistic theories. In particular, I will explain how to construct higher sheaf representation of first-order intuitionistic theories, and discuss some possible outcomes.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2024-03-13 09:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Wednesday, 13 March 2024, 09:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 24a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2024/03/04/lauri-hella/"> <h3>Game characterizations for the number of quantifiers</h3> <h4>Lauri Hella, Tampere University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>A game that characterizes definability of classes of structures by first-order sentences containing a given number of quantifiers was introduced by Immerman in 1981.

An operator-argument-position pair is called a <em>switcher</em> if it induces such a switch. Switcher semantic systems do not satisfy the standard form of compositionality, but a generalized form, which allows greater flexibility. In earlier work (mostly published), some together with Kathrin Glüer, some with Dag Westerståhl, it has been applied to natural language constructions like proper names in modal contexts, general terms in modal contexts, indexicals in temporal contexts, quotation, and belief contexts. This talk will focus on quantifiers and quantification. First-order quantifiers can be regarded as switchers, switching from truth conditions to satisfaction conditions. The larger topic is quantification into switched contexts.

Kleene’s realizability (JSL 1945) gave a metamathematical (re-)interpretation of arithmetic <em>inside</em> arithmetic.

There are, however, interesting non-normal logics that are not, but which nevertheless satisfy a weak form of conjunctive closure. One example is a notion of group knowledge in epistemic logic: somebody-knows. While something is general knowledge if it is known by <em>everyone</em>, this notion holds if it is known by <em>someone</em>. Somebody-knows is thus weaker than general knowledge but stronger than distributed knowledge. We introduce a modality for somebody-knows in the style of standard group knowledge modalities, and study its properties. Unlike most other group knowledge modalities, somebody-knows is not a normal modality; in particular it lacks the conjunctive closure property. We provide an equivalent neighbourhood semantics for the language with a single somebody-knows modality, together with a completeness result: the somebody-knows modalities are completely characterised by the modal logic EMN extended with a particular weak conjunctive closure axiom. The neighbourhood semantics and the completeness and complexity results also carry over other logics with weak conjunctive closure, including the logic of so-called local reasoning (Fagin et al., 1995) with bounded “frames of mind”, correcting an existing completeness result in the literature (Allen 2005).

Calling these calculi constructive, we show that any strong enough constructive sequent calculus, satisfying a mild technical condition, feasibly admits all Visser’s rules, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm that reads a proof of the premise of a Visser’s rule and provides a proof for its conclusion. As a positive application, we show the feasible admissibility of Visser’s rules in several sequent calculi for intuitionistic modal logics, including CK, IK and their extensions by the modal axioms T, B, 4, 5, the modal axioms of bounded width and depth and the propositional lax logic. On the negative side, we show that if a strong enough intuitionistic modal logic (satisfying a mild technical condition) does not admit at least one of Visser’s rules, then it cannot have a constructive sequent calculus. Consequently, no intermediate logic other than IPC has a constructive sequent calculus.

For modal logics, limit behavior for models and frames may differ. In 1994, Halpern and Kapron proved zero-one laws for classes of models corresponding to the modal logics K, T, S4, and S5. They also proposed zero-one laws for the corresponding classes of frames, but their zero-one law for K-frames has since been disproved, and so has more recently their zero-one law for S4-frames.</p> </div></summary> <p>Provability logic was one of the main interests of Per Lindström. In this talk, we prove zero-one laws for provability logic with respect to both model and frame validity. Moreover, we axiomatize validity in almost all irreflexive transitive finite models and in almost all irreflexive transitive finite frames, leading to two different axiom systems. In the proofs, we use a combinatorial result by Kleitman and Rothschild about the structure of finite (strict) partial orders: almost all of them consist of only three layers. Finally, we present empirical results in order to give an idea of the number of elements from which onwards a formula’s almost sure validity or almost sure invalidity stabilizes in such three-layer Kleitman-Rothschild frames. We also discuss possible extensions of the zero-one laws to the modal logics S4 and K4.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-05-11 18:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Thursday, 11 May 2023, 18:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2023 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/04/28/wehr-licentiate/"> <h3>Representation matters in cyclic proof theory</h3> <h4>Licentiate defence: Dominik Wehr, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Public defence of Dominik Wehr’s Licentiate thesis.</p> <p><strong>Opponent</strong> Associate Professor Anupam Das, University of Birmingham<br> <strong>Examiner</strong> Docent Fredrik Engström, Göteborgs universitet<br> Thesis available at the <a href="https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/75984" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gothenburg University Library Archive</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-28 14:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 28 April 2023, 14:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/wofpip"> <h3>Workshop on Fixed Points and Ill-founded Proofs, 27-28 April, 2023</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Held on 27-28 April, 2023 at the University of Gothenburg, this workshop brought together researchers working on various aspects of fixed point logics and ill-founded proofs.

We raise the question whether there are any further requirements, not entailed by these five, that ought to be imposed. One possible reply is dismissed: that the logical system should allow one to infer any proposition at all from an inconsistent set—i.e., it should have as primitive, or allow one to derive, the rule Ex Falso Quodlibet. We then propose that the logic should be implosive: it should not allow an inconsistent set to have any consequences other than absurdity. This proposal may appear to be very radical; but we hope to show that it is robust against objections.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 April 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/04/21/johannes-klubhofer/"> <h3>Using automata theory to obtain a new proof system for the modal µ-calculus</h3> <h4>Johannes Kloibhofer, ILLC, Amsterdam</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Automata theory has various applications in the theory of the modal µ-calculus.

Since the introduction by Hodges, and refinement by Väänänen, team semantic constructions have been used to generate expressively enriched logics still conserving nice properties, such as compactness or decidability. In contrast these logics fail to be substitutional, limiting any algebraic treatment, and rendering fully schematic proof systems impossible. This shortcoming can be attributed to the <em>flatness principle</em>, commonly adhered to when generating team semantics.</p> <p>Investigating the formation of team logics from an algebraic perspective, and disregarding the flatness-principle, I will present the <em>logic of teams</em> (LT), a substitutional logic for which important propositional team logics are axiomatisable as fragments. Starting from classical propositional logic and Boolean algebras, we give semantics for LT by considering algebras of the form P(B) being the powerset of a Boolean algebra B, treated with treated with an <em>internal</em> (derived from B) and an <em>external</em> (set-theoretic) set of connectives. Furthermore, we present a well-motivated labelled natural deduction system for LT, for which a further analysis motivates a generalisation to constructions of logics by combinations of an internal and an external logic, where for LT both are classical propositional logic.</p> <p>This is joint work with Fredrik Engström.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-03-10 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 10 March 2023, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/02/27/sven-ove-hansson/"> <h3>How to combine probabilities and full beliefs in a formal system</h3> <h4>Sven Ove Hansson, KTH</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>One of the major problems in formal epistemology is the difficulty of combining probabilistic and full (dichotomous, all-or-nothing) beliefs in one and the same formal framework. Major properties of actual human belief systems, including how they are impacted by our cognitive limitations, are used to introduce a series of desiderata for realistic models of such belief systems. This leads to a criticism of previous attempts to combine representations of both probabilistic and full beliefs in one and the same formal model. Furthermore, a formal model is presented in which this is done differently. One of its major features is that contingent propositions can be transferred in both directions between full beliefs and lower degrees of belief, in a way that mirrors real-life acquisitions and losses of full beliefs. The subsystem consisting of full beliefs has a pattern of change that constitutes a credible system of dichotomous belief change.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-27 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 February 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2023/02/27/fokkens-licentiate/"> <h3>Modelling the logical mind – Using the cognitive architecture ACT-R to model human symbolic reasoning in the description logic ALE</h3> <h4>Licentiate defence: Tjeerd Fokkens, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Public defence of Tjeerd Fokkens’ Licentiate thesis.</p> <p><strong>Opponent</strong> Dr Ing Stefan Borgwardt, Technische Universität Dresden<br> <strong>Examiner</strong> Professor Simon Dobnik, Göteborgs universitet</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-27 10:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 February 2023, 10:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/events/">Events</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/23a%20vt/2023/02/10/graham-leigh/"> <h3>Coinductive Proof Theory</h3> <h4>Graham Leigh, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>I will present recent results and work in progress on adapting proof theoretic methods to non-well-founded notions of proof.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-10 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 10 February 2023, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 23a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/01/30/vann-mcgee/"> <h3>Boolean Degrees of Truth and Classical Rules of Inference</h3> <h4>Vann McGee, MIT</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Compositional semantics that acknowledge vagueness by positing degrees of truth intermediate between truth and falsity can retain classical sentential calculus, provided the degrees form a Boolean algebra.

One such rule is the cut rule, which is a sequent calculus analogue of the well-known modus ponens rule. As the cut rule introduces new formulas into a proof, it makes proofs non-analytic. Therefore, much effort is devoted to show that the cut rule can be eliminated from a given calculus without changing the set of derivable sequents. Such a cut-elimination theorem is established by showing how instances of the cut rule in a given proof can be pushed upwards until the premises of the instances are axioms. One then shows that in this case the instances of cut can be eliminated from the proof. However, this standard strategy does not work when one considers so-called non-wellfounded proofs, which are proofs in which some branches are allowed to be infinitely long. Clearly, in such a setting it is not enough to simply push instances of cut upwards, as a leaf might never be reached. In this talk I will present ongoing research on cut-elimination for non-wellfounded proofs for a fragment of the modal mu-calculus. I will discuss the basic idea how to construct a cut-free proof from a given non-wellfounded proof and present some of the current problems of my method.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-11-11 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 11 November 2022, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 22b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/22b%20ht/2022/10/28/thomas-studer/"> <h3>Cut-elimination for modal logics with fixed points</h3> <h4>Thomas Studer, University of Bern</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Modal fixed point logics are extensions of modal logics with operators denoting least, respectively greatest, fixed points of certain positive formulas.

And thus, of what it means to be a logic. The basic idea behind ST is that it evaluates the premises and the conclusions of its consequence relation differently, with the premises held to stricter standards while conclusions are treated more tolerantly. More specifically, ST is a three-valued logic with left sides of sequents understood as if in Kleene’s Strong Three Valued Logic, and right sides as if in Priest’s Logic of Paradox. Surprisingly, this hybrid validates the same sequents that classical logic does, though it differs from classical logic at the metaconsequence level. A version of this result has been extended to meta, metameta , etc. consequence levels, creating a very interesting hierarchy of logics. All this is work of others, and I will summarize it.</p> </div></summary> <p>My contribution to the subject is to show that the original ideas behind ST are, in fact, much more general than it first seemed, and an infinite family of many valued logics have Strict/Tolerant counterparts. Besides classical logic, this family includes both Kleene’s and Priest’s logics themselves, as well as first degree entailment. For instance, for both the Kleene and the Priest logic, the corresponding strict/tolerant logic is six-valued, but with differing sets of strictly and tolerantly designated truth values. There is a reverse notion, of Tolerant/Strict logics, which exist for the same structures. And the hierarchy going through meta, metameta, \ldots consequence levels exists for the same infinite family of many valued logics. In a similar way all this work extends to modal and quantified many valued logics. In brief, we have here a very general phenomenon.</p> <p>I will present a sketch of the basic generalizations, of Strict/Tolerant and Tolerant/Strict, but I will not have time to discuss the hierarchies of such logics, nor will I have time to give proofs, beyond a basic sketch of the ideas involved.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-10-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 October 2022, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/22b%20ht/2022/10/14/guilermo-menendez-turata/"> <h3>A Cyclic Proof System for Full Computation Tree Logic</h3> <h4>Guillermo Menéndez Turata, University of Amsterdam</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Full Computation Tree Logic, commonly denoted CTL*, extends Linear Temporal Logic LTL by path quantification for reasoning about branching time.

They typically reveal how he arrived at his results, as with the incompleteness theorem. An extreme case are Gödel’s 1938 results on set theory, preceded by some 700 pages of notes never studied before. Secondly, his threshold for publishing was by 1940 so high that some two thousand pages of developments and results remained unknown. One highlight here is a series of notebooks titled “Resultate Grundlagen” in which numerous anticipations of later results in set theory are found. A second main topic are the relations between modal and intuitionistic logic. In particular, Gödel gives a syntactic translation from S4 to intuitionistic logic by methods that are readily generalizable to any decent intermediate logics. These newly discovered methods are, even by today’s standards, a clear step ahead in the study of interrelations between systems of non-classical logics.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-09-26 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 26 September 2022, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/2022/09/16/clasp-conference/"> <h3>CLASP Conference on (Dis)embodiment</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>(Dis)embodiment is a conference organized by the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/clasp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP)</a>, at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science.

In the area of description logic, deciding whether a logical theory is a conservative extension of another theory is a fundamental reasoning problem with applications in ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology modularity, ontology reuse and ontology versioning. It has been observed in recent years that conservative extensions are decidable in many modal and description logics, given that they can often be characterized elegantly in terms of appropriate notions of bisimulations. But no work has been done for more expressive logics such as the two-variable fragment and the guarded fragment, which are considered to be generalizations of modal and description logics, and are typically used to explain their good computational behavior.</p> </div></summary> <p>&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>In this talk, I attempt to fill this gap by considering the decidability of conservative extensions in the two-variable guarded fragment (<sc>gfo2</sc>).

They play a big role in any field using large amounts of data, e.g. artificial intelligence, databases, and they are of importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web. A common battle in the world of DLs is the one between expressivity, where we add fixpoints, inverses, role restrictions, etc, to a standard DL, and decidability. That is why more expressive as well as light-weight DLs are considered, which both benefit from different derivation system. In this talk I will first give an introduction on the general area of Description Logic, and then focus on the different reasoning problems and how they are solved proof-theoretically. The main result will be on Martin Hofmann’s paper, presenting the sequent calculus for the light description logic EL with the fixpoint extension, and see how cyclic proofs are used in this context.

We provide normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions are definable, and conversely, discuss which logical notions and reasoning principles can be defined out of arithmetical ones. Next we study a series of strengthenings in the same style, including second-order versions, systems with multiple counting, and a new modal logic with counting. As a complement to our fragment approach, we also discuss another way of controlling complexity: changing the semantics of counting to reason about ‘mass’ or other aggregating notions than cardinalities. Finally, we return to the basic reasoning practices that lie embedded in natural language, confronting our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary, monotonicity reasoning, and procedural semantics via semantic automata. We conclude with some pointers to further entanglements of logic and counting in the metamathematics of formal systems, the philosophy of logic, and cognitive psychology.

Second, the determinant invariance of the domain of number is the fungibility of objects: If an object in a collection is exchanged for another object, the collection will still contain the same number of objects. Fungibility will be shown to be closely related to one-to-one correspondences.</p> <p>We first introduce the concept of a collection and show how it differs from the concept of a set.

In the classical Boolean semantics, a model of a formula assigns to each (instantiated) literal a Boolean value. K-interpretations, for a semiring K, generalize this by assigning to each such literal a value from K. We then interpret 0 as false and all other semiring values as nuances of true, which provide additional information, depending on the semiring: For example, the Boolean semiring over {0,1} corresponds classical semantics, the Viterbi-semiring can model confidence scores, the tropical semiring is used for cost analysis, and min-max-semirings (A, max, min, a, b) for a totally ordered set (A,&lt;) can model different access levels. Most importantly, semirings of polynomials, such as N[X], allow us to track certain literals by mapping them to different indeterminates. The overall value of the formula is then a polynomial that describes precisely what combinations of literals prove the truth of the formula.</p> </div></summary> <p>This can also be used for strategy analysis in games. Evaluating formulae that define winning regions in a given game in an appropriate semiring of polynomials provides not only the Boolean information on who wins, but also tells us how they win and which strategies they might use. For this approach, the case of Büchi games is of special interest, not only due to their practical importance, but also because it is the simplest case where the logical definition of the winning region involves a genuine alternation of a greatest and a least fixed point. We show that, in a precise sense, semiring semantics provide information about all absorption-dominant strategies – strategies that win with minimal effort, and we discuss how these relate to positional and the more general persistent strategies. This information enables further applications such as game synthesis or determining minimal modifications to the game needed to change its outcome.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-10-25 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 25 October 2021, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/21b%20ht/2021/10/15/joao-pedro-paulos/"> <h3>A collection of small closed sets: sets of uniqueness</h3> <h4>João Pedro Paulos, Chalmers</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Sets of uniqueness and their properties are traditionally investigated in Harmonic Analysis.

The truth theory delivers a natural preorder on the set of axiomatizations: an axiomatization A is greater or equal to an axiomatization B if and only if, over CT<sup>-</sup>[EA], the assertion “All axioms from A are true” implies “All axioms from B are true”.

We show that NbE models can be constructed for calculi that incorporate the K, T and 4 axioms, with suitable instantiations of the frames in their possible world semantics.

People had criticised Aristotle’s logic before, but not at these points. At first Avicenna had no clear understanding of how to do modal logic, and it took him another thirty years to justify all the criticisms of Aristotle in his report. But meanwhile he discovered for himself how to defend a new logic by building new foundations. I think the logic itself is interesting, but the talk will concentrate on another aspect. These recent discoveries mean that Avicenna is the earliest known logician who creates new logics and tells us what he is doing, and why, at each stage along the way.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2021-05-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 May 2021, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/21a%20vt/2021/05/21/mattias-granberg-olsson/"> <h3>A proof of conservativity of fixed points over Heyting arithmetic via truth</h3> <h4>Mattias Granberg Olsson, FLoV</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"><details> <summary><div> <p>I will present work in progress (together with Graham Leigh) on a novel proof of the conservativity of the intuitionistic fix-point theory over Heyting arithmetic (HA), originally proved in full generality by Arai [1].</p> </div></summary> <p>We make use of the work of van den Berg and van Slooten [2] on realizability in Heyting arithmetic over Beeson’s logic of partial terms (HAP). Let IF be the extension of Heyting arithmetic by fix-points, denoted \hat{ID}<sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub> in the literature. The proof is divided into four parts: First we extend the inclusion of HA into HAP to IF into a similar theory IFP in the logic of partial terms. We then show that every theorem of this theory provably has a realizer in the theory IFP(Λ) of fix-points for almost negative operator forms only. Constructing a hierarchy stratifying the class of almost negative formulae and partial truth predicates for this hierarchy, we use Gödel’s diagonal lemma to show IFP(Λ) is interpretable in HAP. Finally we use use the result of [2] that adding the schema of “self-realizability” for arithmetic formulae to HAP is conservative over HA.

The original Tr-cut-elimination argument for the theory of Tarskian, compositional truth CT[B] by Halbach is not conclusive. This strategy has been corrected by Graham Leigh: Leigh supplemented Halbach’s strategy with the machinery of approximations (introduced by Kotlarski, Krajewski and Lachlan in the context of their M-Logic). In the talk we investigate a different, and arguably simpler way of supplementing Halbach’s original strategy. It is based on an adaptation of the Takeuti/Buss free-cut elimination strategy for first-order logic to the richer truth-theoretic context.

The first generalisation I have in mind is Feferman’s theorem on the “interpretability of inconsistency”. This result strengthens the second incompleteness theorem, by showing that the sentence expressing that PA is inconsistent is not only consistent with PA, but even that PA + “PA is inconsistent” is interpretable in PA. The second generalisation is due to Kripke, who showed that there is a flexible formula: a formula “whose extension as a set is left undetermined” by PA.</p> </div></summary> <p>In particular, he constructed a Σ-1 formula γ(x), such that for every Σ-1 formula σ(x), the theory PA + “γ = σ” is consistent. This result generalises the first incompleteness theorem, since any instance of such a γ must be independent of PA. Unfortunately, the straightforward combination of Feferman’s and Kripke’s theorems — the “interpretability of flexibility” — is a false claim. Indeed, it is easy to show that there can be no Σ-1 formula γ such that for all Σ-1 formulae σ, the theory PA + “γ = σ” is interpretable in PA.</p> <p>There are, however, several weaker results available, due to Enayat, Hamkins, Shavrukov, Woodin, and me. These results either (1) relax the restriction on γ, (2) further restrict the allowed choices of σ’s, (3) strengthen the interpreting theory beyond PA, or (4) use equality modulo finite differences. I will present these four intermediate results, along with the remaining question that they all fail to answer. Finally, I will discuss why the known proof method does not seem to lend itself to giving a positive answer to this remaining question, as well as explain how any counterexample would have to look.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2020-12-18 10:15:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 18 December 2020, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 20b HT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/20b%20ht/2020/11/20/rajeev-gore/"> <h3>Bi-Intuitionistic Logics: a New Instance of an Old Problem</h3> <h4>Rajeev Goré, Australian National University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>As anyone who reads the literature on bi-intuitionistic logic will know, the numerous papers by Cecylia Rauszer are foundational but confusing. For example: these papers claim and retract various versions of the deduction theorem for bi-intuitionistic logic; they erroneously claim that the calculus is complete with respect to rooted canonical models; and they erroneously claim the admissibility of cut in her sequent calculus for this logic. Worse, authors such as Crolard, have based some of their own foundational work on these confused and confusing results and proofs. We trace this confusion to the axiomatic formalism of RBiInt in which Rauszer first characterized bi-intuitionistic logic and show that, as in modal logic, RBiInt can be interpreted as two different consequence relations. We remove this ambiguity by using generalized Hilbert calculi, which are tailored to capture consequence relations. We show that RBiInt leads to two logics, wBIL and sBIL, with different extensional and meta-level properties, and that they are, respectively, sound and strongly complete with respect to the Kripkean local and global semantic consequence relations of bi-intuitionistic logic.

Recently, in the context of homotopy type theory people have started to consider a version of type theory in which all computation rules are replaced by propositional equalities. In this talk, I will discuss this version of type theory, which one could call “objective type theory”. In particular, I will show that if one formulates this objective type theory with sufficient care, type checking can be done in quadratic time.

We will be interested in measuring the “logical distance” between the two canonical sets of principles and determining whether each of them “determine” the other. Working in the framework of axiomatic truth theories we shall consider various ways of formalizing the above two questions and present the current state of art. The talk initializes the project (under the same name) which started in Warsaw at the beginning of September. At the current time there are still much more questions than answers, but we believe that it is worth uncovering this research perspective.

The framework of Dependence logic, so-called team semantics, has turned out to be very flexible and allows for interesting generalizations. Instead of considering satisfaction with respect to a single assignment s, team semantics considers sets of assignments X, called teams. While the semantics of Dependence logic is based on the principle that a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if every assignment s ∈ X satisfies φ, we will replace this principle by the following: a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if for every assignment s: s ∈ X iff s satisfies φ, replacing an implication by an equivalence. When only first-order logic is considered nothing exciting happens, it is only when we introduce new logical operations that things start to get more exciting.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2020-05-08 10:15:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Friday, 8 May 2020, 10:15</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/seminars/">Research Seminar</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 20a VT </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/2019/2019/11/21/johan-van-benthem-research/"> <h3>Dynamic Logics of Model Change (Research Lindström Lecture)</h3> <h4>Johan van Benthem, University of Amsterdam, Stanford University, Tsinghua University Beijing</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Information update and real-world action suggest a universe of changing models, where finding the valid dynamic laws involves logical languages with modalities for model change.

In this lecture, I will develop the dynamic perspective, showing how key aspects of rational agency fit in the agenda of logic, such as handling and integrating information from various sources, revising erroneous beliefs, and balancing information with preferences and goals. In this lecture, the vehicle for achieving this will be dynamic-epistemic logics for various sorts of update. These mesh eventually with richer logics of games and strategic interaction. After all, much of reasoning is a social multi-agent process: ‘intelligence seldom comes alone’. I end this part by noting how the two faces of logic share the same methodology, and are in fact complementary.</p> <p>However, ‘more logic’ is just one way to go in studying agency. I briefly discuss current challenges from the ‘less logic’ camp, where successful behavior is explained by dynamical systems with very simple agents, or from learning systems that may not have a logical formulation at all. I hope to show that logic retains a valuable role even in that stormy setting.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2019-11-20 19:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Wednesday, 20 November 2019, 19:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/lindstrom-lectures/">Lindström Lectures</a>   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> 2019 </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/events/Gothenburg-Warsaw-Truth-Workshop/"> <h3>Gothenburg–Warsaw Workshop on Truth</h3> <h4></h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The Gothenburg–Warsaw workshop on truth was held on Thursday, 6 December 2018 at the <a href="https://www.gu.se/flov" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science</a> at the University of Gothenburg.
