In the second part, I show the progression from Nicholas of Paris (1240s) and Albert the Great (1250s), who see Aristotelian logic as a systematic scientific method where syllogistic argument is fundamental, but who struggle to coherently organize it around syllogistic argument, to Radulphus Brito (1290s) who, still seeing Aristotelian logic as scientific method, uses the notion of ‘second intention’ in order to coherently structure it around syllogistic argument.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="nol"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This presentation aims to show that medieval Aristotelian logic can be generally characterized as scientific method.
