Until then the task of a logician had been to design and explain a full-scale formal language that was adequate for the practice of mathematical analysis in such a way that the axioms and rules of inference of the theory were rendered evident by the explanations. </p> <p>The metamathematical turn changed the status of the formal languages: now they became (meta)mathematical objects of study. We no longer communicate <em>with</em> the aid of the formal systems – we communicate <em>about</em> them. Kleene’s realizability (JSL 1945) gave a metamathematical (re-)interpretation of arithmetic <em>inside</em> arithmetic. Heyting and Kolmogorov (1931-2), on the other hand, had used “proofs” of <em>propositions</em>, respectively “solutions” to <em>problems,</em> in order to explain the meaning of the mathematical language, rather than reinterpret it internally.</p> <p>We now have the choice to view the Curry-Howard isomorphism, say, as a variant of realizability, when it will be an <em>internal</em> mathematical re-interpretation, or to adopt an <em>atavistic,</em> Frege-like, viewpoint and look at the language as being rendered meaningful. This perspective will be used to discuss another paradigm shift, namely that of distinguishing <em>constructivism</em> and <em>intuitionism</em>. The hesitant attitude of Gödel, Kreisel, and Michael Dummett, will be spelled out, and, at the hand of unpublished source material, a likely reason given.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="NOL Seminar"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around 1930 a major paradigm shift occurred in the foundations of mathematics; we may call it the METAMATHEMATICAL TURN.
