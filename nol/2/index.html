There are, however, interesting non-normal logics that are not, but which nevertheless satisfy a weak form of conjunctive closure. One example is a notion of group knowledge in epistemic logic: somebody-knows. While something is general knowledge if it is known by <em>everyone</em>, this notion holds if it is known by <em>someone</em>. Somebody-knows is thus weaker than general knowledge but stronger than distributed knowledge. We introduce a modality for somebody-knows in the style of standard group knowledge modalities, and study its properties. Unlike most other group knowledge modalities, somebody-knows is not a normal modality; in particular it lacks the conjunctive closure property. We provide an equivalent neighbourhood semantics for the language with a single somebody-knows modality, together with a completeness result: the somebody-knows modalities are completely characterised by the modal logic EMN extended with a particular weak conjunctive closure axiom. The neighbourhood semantics and the completeness and complexity results also carry over other logics with weak conjunctive closure, including the logic of so-called local reasoning (Fagin et al., 1995) with bounded “frames of mind”, correcting an existing completeness result in the literature (Allen 2005). The talk is based on joint work with Yi N. Wang.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-08-28 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 28 August 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/05/22/magdalena-ortiz/"> <h3>A Short Introduction to SHACL for Logicians</h3> <h4>Magdalena Ortiz, Umeå University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The SHACL Shapes Constraint Language was recommended in 2017 by the W3C for describing constraints on web data (specifically, on RDF graphs) and validating them. At first glance, it may not seem to be a topic for logicians, but as it turns out, SHACL can be approached as a formal logic, and actually quite an interesting one. In this paper, we give a brief introduction to SHACL tailored towards logicians and frame key uses of SHACL as familiar logic reasoning tasks. We discuss how SHACL relates to description logics, which are the basis of the OWL Web Ontology Languages, a related yet orthogonal standard for web data. Finally, we summarize some of our recent work in the SHACL world, hoping that this may shed light on how ideas, results, and techniques from well-established areas of logic can advance the state of the art in this emerging field.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-05-22 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 22 May 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/04/24/neil-tennant/"> <h3>It's All or Nothing: Explosion v. Implosion</h3> <h4>Neil Tennant, Ohio State University</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>We set out five basic requirements for a logical system to be adequate for the regimentation of deductive reasoning in mathematics and science. We raise the question whether there are any further requirements, not entailed by these five, that ought to be imposed. One possible reply is dismissed: that the logical system should allow one to infer any proposition at all from an inconsistent set—i.e., it should have as primitive, or allow one to derive, the rule Ex Falso Quodlibet. We then propose that the logic should be implosive: it should not allow an inconsistent set to have any consequences other than absurdity. This proposal may appear to be very radical; but we hope to show that it is robust against objections.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-04-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 April 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/03/27/ali-enayat/"> <h3>Arithmetic and set theory through the lens of interpretability</h3> <h4>Ali Enayat, University of Gothenburg</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The notion of (relative) interpretation for first order theories was introduced in a landmark 1953 monograph by Alfred Tarski, Andrzej Mostowski and Raphael Robinson, where it was developed as a powerful tool for establishing undecidability results. By now the domain of interest and applicability of interpretability theory far exceeds undecidability theory owing to its multifaceted interactions with both proof theory and model theory. Special attention will be paid to recent advances in the subject that indicate the distinctive character of Peano Arithmetic, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and their higher order analogues in the realm of interpretability theory.

Major properties of actual human belief systems, including how they are impacted by our cognitive limitations, are used to introduce a series of desiderata for realistic models of such belief systems. This leads to a criticism of previous attempts to combine representations of both probabilistic and full beliefs in one and the same formal model. Furthermore, a formal model is presented in which this is done differently. One of its major features is that contingent propositions can be transferred in both directions between full beliefs and lower degrees of belief, in a way that mirrors real-life acquisitions and losses of full beliefs. The subsystem consisting of full beliefs has a pattern of change that constitutes a credible system of dichotomous belief change.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2023-02-27 16:00:00 +0100"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 27 February 2023, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2023/01/30/vann-mcgee/"> <h3>Boolean Degrees of Truth and Classical Rules of Inference</h3> <h4>Vann McGee, MIT</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>Compositional semantics that acknowledge vagueness by positing degrees of truth intermediate between truth and falsity can retain classical sentential calculus, provided the degrees form a Boolean algebra. A valid deduction guarantees that the degree of truth of the conclusion be at least as great as every lower bound on the degrees of the premises. If we extend the language to allow infinite disjunctions and conjunctions, the Boolean algebra will need to be complete and atomic.

It is a fixed-point modal logic, with modalities for knowledge (modelled as the universal modality), knowability of a proposition (represented by the topological interior operator), and (un)knowability of the actual world. The last notion has a non-self-referential reading (modelled by Cantor derivative: the set of limit points of a given set) and a self-referential one (modelled by the so-called perfect core of a given set: its largest subset which is a fixed point of relativized derivative). I completely axiomatize this logic, showing that it is decidable and PSPACE-complete, as well as briefly explain how the same model-theoretic method can be elaborated to prove the completeness and decidability of the full topological mu-calculus.

In the first chapter of (Weyl 1918), Weyl introduces a predicative concept of set, according to which sets are built ‘from the bottom up’ starting from the natural numbers. Weyl clearly contrasts this predicative concept of set with the concept of arbitrary set, which he finds wanting, especially when working with infinite sets. In the second chapter of Das Kontinuum, he goes on to show that large portions of 19th century analysis can be developed on the basis of his predicative concept of set.</p> </div></summary> <p>Das Kontinuum inspired fundamental ideas in mathematical logic and beyond, such as the logical analysis of predicativity of the 1950-60’s, Solomon Feferman’s work on predicativity and Errett Bishop’s constructive mathematics. The seeds of Das Kontinuum are already visible in the early (Weyl 1910), where Weyl, among other things, offers a clarification of Zermelo’s axiom schema of Separation.</p> <p>In this talk, I examine Weyl’s predicative concept of set in (Weyl 1918) and discuss its origins in (Weyl 1910).</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <ul> <li>Weyl, H., 1910, Über die Definitionen der mathematischen Grundbegriffe, Mathematischnaturwissenschaftliche Blätter, 7, pp. 93-95 and pp. 109-113.</li> <li>Weyl, H., 1918, Das Kontinuum.

And thus, of what it means to be a logic. The basic idea behind ST is that it evaluates the premises and the conclusions of its consequence relation differently, with the premises held to stricter standards while conclusions are treated more tolerantly. More specifically, ST is a three-valued logic with left sides of sequents understood as if in Kleene’s Strong Three Valued Logic, and right sides as if in Priest’s Logic of Paradox. Surprisingly, this hybrid validates the same sequents that classical logic does, though it differs from classical logic at the metaconsequence level. A version of this result has been extended to meta, metameta , etc. consequence levels, creating a very interesting hierarchy of logics. All this is work of others, and I will summarize it.</p> </div></summary> <p>My contribution to the subject is to show that the original ideas behind ST are, in fact, much more general than it first seemed, and an infinite family of many valued logics have Strict/Tolerant counterparts. Besides classical logic, this family includes both Kleene’s and Priest’s logics themselves, as well as first degree entailment. For instance, for both the Kleene and the Priest logic, the corresponding strict/tolerant logic is six-valued, but with differing sets of strictly and tolerantly designated truth values. There is a reverse notion, of Tolerant/Strict logics, which exist for the same structures. And the hierarchy going through meta, metameta, \ldots consequence levels exists for the same infinite family of many valued logics. In a similar way all this work extends to modal and quantified many valued logics. In brief, we have here a very general phenomenon.</p> <p>I will present a sketch of the basic generalizations, of Strict/Tolerant and Tolerant/Strict, but I will not have time to discuss the hierarchies of such logics, nor will I have time to give proofs, beyond a basic sketch of the ideas involved.</p> </details></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-10-24 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 24 October 2022, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> <li> <a class="post-title" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2022/09/26/jan-van-plato/"> <h3>Gödel's work in logic and foundations in the light of his shorthand notebooks</h3> <h4>Jan von Plato, University of Helsinki</h4> </a> <div class="post-body"> <p>The study of Gödel’s shorthand notebooks in the ERC project GODELIANA has revealed two main aspects of his work: First, there is behind each of his relatively few published papers an enormous amount of notes. They typically reveal how he arrived at his results, as with the incompleteness theorem. An extreme case are Gödel’s 1938 results on set theory, preceded by some 700 pages of notes never studied before. Secondly, his threshold for publishing was by 1940 so high that some two thousand pages of developments and results remained unknown. One highlight here is a series of notebooks titled “Resultate Grundlagen” in which numerous anticipations of later results in set theory are found. A second main topic are the relations between modal and intuitionistic logic. In particular, Gödel gives a syntactic translation from S4 to intuitionistic logic by methods that are readily generalizable to any decent intermediate logics. These newly discovered methods are, even by today’s standards, a clear step ahead in the study of interrelations between systems of non-classical logics.</p> </div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-meta"> <time datetime="2022-09-26 16:00:00 +0200"><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar fa-sm"></i> Monday, 26 September 2022, 16:00</time>   ·   <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-sm"> </i> <a href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/">Nordic Online Logic Seminar</a> </div> </div> </li> </ul> <nav aria-label="Blog page naviation"> <ul class="pagination pagination-lg justify-content-center"> <li class="page-item "> <a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="1">Newer</a> </li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/index.html" title="Nordic Online Logic Seminar">1</a></li> <li class="page-item active"><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/2/index.html" title="Nordic Online Logic Seminar - page 2">2</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/3/index.html" title="Nordic Online Logic Seminar - page 3">3</a></li> <li class="page-item "><a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/4/index.html" title="Nordic Online Logic Seminar - page 4">4</a></li> <li class="page-item "> <a class="page-link" href="/Logic-GU-new/nol/3/">Older</a> </li> </ul> </nav> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Graham E.
